# Ooyala IQ SDK for Roku

This library allows you to report video events (content started, content paused, and so on) and certain user metrics (platform, OS, and so on) from your Roku channels to Ooyala IQ. It provides a very simple and easy to use API through the [IQ](IQ.html) object.

## Roku requirements

The minimum Roku OS version compatible with this library is v7.

## Getting started

See the [Getting Started tutorial](tutorial-getting_started.html) for information about how to use the library.

## Sample app

A sample app is available [here](https://github.com/ooyala/iq-sdk-roku-sample). It demonstrates the Roku IQ library integrated with both a roVideoScreen and a roVideoPlayer.
