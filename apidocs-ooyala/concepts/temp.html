                    <p class="p">Android is requiring apps built for 64 bit compatibility by August 1, 2019 (new apps): <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html</a></p>

                    <p class="p">Starting from 0.59, React Native is 64 bit. Therefore, to allow our customers to have 64-bit support, we upgraded our React Native version in our SDKs to version 0.59.4</p>

                <!-- <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Chapter/Timeline Markers</strong></p>

                  <p class="p">Markers are graphical objects superimposed over the Ooyala timeline. Markers are used to display a variety of metadata about a file:</p>
                  <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Instantaneous events can be displayed. In this case, the length of the timeline marker is determined by the player, and is designed to be the minimal width that is easily seen and clickable.</li>
                    <li class="li">Timed duration events can be displayed. In this case, the metadata displays the marker on the timeline for the given duration.</li>
                    <li class="li">Markers can be associated with colors, images/icons and/or descriptive text inside a standardized UI container for the maker.</li>
                    <li class="li">The timing of markers can be defined with respect to the beginning or end of the timeline to show the duration of the identified event duration (beginning and end).</li>
                    <li class="li">The Marker JSON file can be ingested prior to playback and/or updated via player API at any time, similar to a Closed Caption file. The timeline marker will also be delivered to the player via the Content Tree API.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>
                  <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">By clicking on a marker container (above the timeline), the playhead will jump to the defined start time for the marker. </li>
                    <li class="li">If the user clicks on the highlighted marker area on the timeline itself, it will move the playhead to that exact point, rather than to the beginning of the chapter marker. That is, the timeline marker will behave as it does normally, with or without Chapter Markers.</li>
                    <li class="li">If the user does a hover (or other) even that invokes the scrubber thumbnails, these thumbnails will appear on top of the scrubber thumbnails - they have visual priority over the chapter markers above the timeline.</li>
                  </ul>

                      <p class="p">This is the most requested feature for Ooyalar applications. Users need to be able to access the Chromecast controls within the video player itself from Skin SDK. </p>

                          Enable cast controls in skin.json. By default castControls in skin.json are disabled so it is necessary to turn the on them in skin.json:

                          <p>In this section of skin.json it is also possible to manage the style of cast controls and what controls should be shown.</p>

                    <p class="p">A new sample app shows how we currently support the OoyalaPlayer in a UICollectionView. The name of the app is misleading since it is called MultiplePlayersScrollingViewSampleApp, but it only shows how to add OoyalaPlayers as items in a UICollectionView.</p>
                    <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ul">
                      <li class="li">iOS SDK installed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
                    <p class="p">The main idea is to use a single instance of Ooyala Player and reuse it when a cell is visible.</p>
                    <p class="p"><code>OOSkinViewController</code> is initialized only once, the parent collection layout adds <code>OOSkinViewController</code> once the next item of <code>UICollectionView</code> is seen and removes it when scrolling reveals another video.</p>
                    <p class="p">In the sample app, multiple players should be embedded and perform the following:</p>
                    <ul class="ul">
                      <li class="li">As the user scrolls, the video autoplays when the player is fully in view.</li>
                      <li class="li">Once scrolling continues, that player should be automatically paused.</li>
                      <li class="li">Once scrolling reveals another player and scrolling stops, playback should be automatically started.</li>
                      <li class="li">The playhead time is saved for each video and each video starts from the time it was paused.</li>
                      <li class="li">If the user unmutes any video player, all future videos should start up unmuted.</li>
                      <li class="li">Embedded container should use most of the screen when viewed vertically, except for a header taking up some space title "Video Feed". Video embeds are separated by the text of the video title centered inline on the video list.</li>
                      <li class="li">If the user moves the device to view horizontally while a video is being played, it automatically goes full-screen on the video.</li>
                      <li class="li">If the user returns to portrait mode, the video becomes viewed as embedded in video list again.</li>
                      <li class="li">If a video is not playing while viewed horizontally, then the list is expanded to full width.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>ViewControllers</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ul">
                      <li class="li"><code>MultiplePlayerViewController</code> demonstrates how to use <code>UICollectionView</code> with several reusable instances of OoyalaPlayer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
                    <p class="p">Set the <code>OOOoyalaPlayerActionAtEnd</code> as <code>OOOoyalaPlayerActionAtEndReset</code>.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Enable OpenMeasurement in Google IMA SDKs</strong></p>
                    <p class="p">The Open Measurement SDK is an upcoming viewability and verification platform integrated into the iOS and Android IMA SDKs. It is jointly developed by the OM Working Group of the IAB, including: Google, DoubleVerify, IAS, Moat and others. The platform runs Javascript provided by any verification vendor conforming to the IAB VAST and OMID specs. These scripts are fed into the IMA SDK within an <AdVerifications> node in VAST 4.1, or in an <Extension type=”AdVerifications”> in VAST pre-4.1. See the VAST 4.1 spec and communicate with your verification vendor for more details.</p>
                    <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
                  <p class="p">The OMSDK provides advanced viewability metrics for buyers and publishers from many verification vendors in a single integration. For publishers using the IMA SDK already, this integration comes at no extra implementation cost. The setup for verification script trafficking in VAST depends on the campaign type.</p>

                <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Support for audio playback from another application when Player audio is muted</strong></p>

                    <p class="p">In this release, we introduce the option to allow audio playback from another application to continue when the video player is muted.</p>

                    <p class="p">To this end, we have implemented the new <samp class="ph codeph">OOAudioSession</samp> class as a singleton. It is a wrapper around <samp class="ph codeph">AVAudioSession</samp>, which handles prioritization. This class also enables you to easily subscribe to notifications about volume changes.</p>

                    <p class="p">If you have a custom skin fullscreen implementation, you can use one of the following settings:</p>

                    <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">OOAudioSession::prioritize()</samp></li>

                        <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">OOAudioSession::deprioritize()</samp></li>

                    </ul>

                        <p class="p">If you do not have a custom skin fullscreen implementation, the behaviour will be as follows.</p>

                        <p class="p">If <samp class="ph codeph">OOyalaPlayer</samp> is muted and audio from another app is being played during video playback, <samp class="ph codeph">OOyalaPlayer</samp> will continue to play the video with the original audio muted and with audio playback from another app. At this point, the audio playback from the other app will be muted and the original audio playback will be played if one of the following actions is taken:</p>

                    <ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">The user increases or changes the volume while <samp class="ph codeph">OOyalaPlayer</samp> is open.</li>

                        <li class="li">The user enters into fullscreen mode while <samp class="ph codeph">OOyalaPlayer</samp> is open.</li>

                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Support for multiple ads when configured in Backlot</strong></p>

                    <p class="p">In this release, we have introduced support for multiple ads when these are configured in Backlot.</p>

                    <p class="p">We have implemented logic to display pre-rolls, mid-rolls, and post-rolls with no ad-rules. As a result we now support multiple IMA ads, which can be podded ads, no ad-rules, or ad rules.</p>

                    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In this release, mid-roll, and post-roll ads with no ad-rules do not get
                        paused. This limitation will be addressed in a future release.</div>

                <li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Support for closed captions for offline asset playback</strong></p>

                    <p class="p">In this release, we have introduced support for Closed Captions for assets when these are played offline.</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Fixed an issue where, with the TVoS SDK, the progress bar would not update until after content was buffered. Now the progress bar will immediately update based on the position set by the remote.</li>

                <li class="li">Fixed an issue where opening the menu to change languages would pause the video. We have addressed this problem by changing the behavior for the multi-audio menu (using Skin SDK).</li>

                <li class="li">Fixed an issue where seeking to the end of the video when using AirPlay would not resume playback at the seek point.</li>

                <li class="li">Fixed a cosmetic issue with the control bar related to toggling between monoscopic and stereoscopic mode with VR 360 videos.</li>

                <li class="li">Fixed an issue with the Chromecast Sender where playback on the Chromecast Receiver would continue even after disconnecting the device.</li>

                <li class="li">Fixed an issue with Accessibility mode where the audible instructions for how to navigate the progress bar were incorrect.</li>

                <li class="li">Fixed an issue where post-roll ads would not play after video content playback ended when using AirPlay.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Known Issues in this Release</strong></p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">When playing a video offline that has Closed Captions, seeking to the end of the video may cause the player to get stuck at the end of the video.</li>

                <li class="li">There is currently an issue with using podded ads with Google Ad Manager combined with AirPlay.</li>

                <li class="li">Using playback speeds larger than 1X during ad breaks using Ooyala SSAI may cause playback issues of the ads with post-rolls.</li>

                        while values above this range default to 2.0x. The

                        disabling or modifying tracking for the GUID value that the Ooyala Player
                        generates and stores to identify the uniqueness of devices. Ooyala considers
                        this information to be necessary for delivery of services, but it is up to
                        each customer to define their own compliance requirements with GDPR.
                        However, it is VERY IMPORTANT to understand that if these opt-outs are used,
                        it will a) irreparably impact the accuracy of your analytics information,
                        and b) it may impact the player’s behavior for features that rely on this
                        value, such as recommendations (Discovery) and Cross-Device Resume.
                        Recommendation: only use this when deemed necessary, and apply per end-user
                        basis.</div>
 The Player provides three setting levels for tracking metrics:
                        <strong class="ph b">Default</strong>, <strong class="ph b">Disabled</strong>, and <strong class="ph b">Anonymous</strong>, as described below:<ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Default:</strong> Used if the value is explicitly set to default or if it is undefined. Standard analytics tracking is done in this case. Ooyala does not capture and store personally identifiable information (PII), except where necessary to facilitate specific functions (for example, purchases), and only when it is specifically provided from the website or application. However, Ooyala does create a random unique device identifier (GUID) that is stored and persists between sessions so that unique user counts can be accurate. Analytics will be enabled and will send data to the analytics servers. The device GUID will stay the same until the app is present on the phone. The device GUID will be stored in local storage.</li>

                            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Disabled:</strong> For this setting, analytics will be COMPLETELY
                            DISABLED and no data will be sent to the analytics servers. In this case
                            all video analytics (media play events) will not be reported for users,
                            so products like IQ will under-report actual usage. <p class="p">Usage
                                example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">[OOOoyalaPlayer setIqAnalyticsTrackingState:OOIQAnalyticsTrackingStateAnonymous]; </pre>

</li>

                            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Anonymous:</strong> For this setting, analytics data will be sent to
                            the analytics servers. Each time a video is played, a new device GUID
                            will be generated. The device GUID will NOT be stored on the
                            device.</li>

                    will be refactoring this skin completely in our next major release.  In
                    addition, on iOS 11 while playing in fullscreen mode, the native volume control
                    might not be visible. If the viewer clicks the screen or rotates the screen to
