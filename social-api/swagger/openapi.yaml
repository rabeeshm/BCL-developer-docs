    API for Brightcove Social

    **Notes:**
    - The Social API is currently in beta. if you are interested in participating in the beta, contact your account manager.
    - While the Social API is in beta, permissions for it are <strong>not</strong> available in the Studio Admin section for Managing API Credentials. Instead, you will have to use the OAuth API to create your credentials. However, Brightcove Learning Services, has created a [simple online tool](https://support.brightcove.com/oauth-api-sample-create-client-credentials) for doing this.
