I agree with both of these, and I think the only other use for Perform besides a &quot;Perform customer&quot; is the &quot;Perform Studio&quot;. That will obviously mostly be used in the UI docs, but you may want to use it in the oAuth docs to reference the UI that can be used to register a new application (once that is available later this week). </div>\n<div><br/></div>\n<div>I've definitely been using Brightcove Player Service in conversation, but Brightcove Player System makes sense to me as well and I think that is probably the best term to use in the docs when referring to the player/player management/delivery system/etc. all together. </div>\n<div><br/></div>\n<div>-Kellie</div>\n</div>\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">Kellie-</span><br/>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"word-wrap: break-word;\">\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">I have been going back and forth with David a bit about semantics around the new player. Here is what we have discussed. I need to know if you have other rules, or these might be good to formalize.</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><br/></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">David is reviewing a standard intro and I will send that on when I get it back.</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">Thanks-</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">M</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><br/></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(243, 247, 251);\">Q: When/how should the term Perform be defined and used?</span></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">A: Perform should be used similarly to how you would use Video Cloud, it’s the thing customers purchase. Do not use “the Perform player” or “the Perform APIs”. <span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;\">I think the only time I would be using the term would be to describe the sort of customer that is the audience for a doc, </span><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;\">like &quot;if you're a Perform or Video Cloud customer, blah blah blah&quot;</span></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><br/></div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">Q: Is it ok to say “Brightcove player system” to mean the player, player management, delivery system, etc.? (Note: Some marketing slides say “Brightcove player service” but David likes “system” better)</div>\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 13px;\">A: I don't have a better term for it</div>\n<br/></div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
