This means that the click events associated with each thumbnail in our scroller will not bubble up to its parent container after the first time you play a video. To work around this, we need to hide both the player and the lightbox container. First, we will check to see if the user is browsing on an iOS device. We do this by creating a variable that sets the userAgent property based on the user's platform.\n\niOS = ( navigator.userAgent.match(/(iPad|iPhone|iPod)/g) ? true : false );"
