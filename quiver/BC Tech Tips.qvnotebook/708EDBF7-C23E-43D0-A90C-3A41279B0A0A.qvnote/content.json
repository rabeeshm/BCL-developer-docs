We are then calling its open method, specifying the HTTP request method as the first parameter and the URL of the page we’re requesting as the second. Finally, we call its send method passing null as a parameter. If POST-ing the request (here we are using GET), this parameter should contain any data we want to send with the request.\n\nAnd this is how we’d deal with the response from the server:\n\nxhr.onreadystatechange = function () {\n  var DONE = 4; // readyState 4 means the request is done.\n  var OK = 200; // status 200 is a successful return.\n  if (xhr.readyState === DONE) {\n    if (xhr.status === OK) \n      console.log(xhr.responseText); // 'This is the returned text.'\n    } else {\n      console.log('Error: ' + xhr.status); // An error occurred during the request.\n    }\n  }\n};"
