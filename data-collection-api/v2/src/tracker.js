 * @apiParam (URL Parameters: All Requests) {String} [device_os_version] The version of os being used by the device. When not specified, this will be calculated by parsing the user agent string for the tracking request

The user data itself cannot retrieved via the API or Analytics module__
 * @apiParam (URL Parameters: `catalog_request` Events) {String} [catalog_url] The destination url associated with the catalog_request event
 * @apiParam (URL Parameters: `catalog_response` Events) {String} [catalog_url] The destination url associated with the catalog_request event that initiated this response

This can be different depending on the experience, for instance, if there are no pre-roll ads configured, this measurement is the time between the `play_request` and `video_view` events. If there is a preroll ad, the time between `ad_mode_begin` and `ad_mode_complete` should not be included
