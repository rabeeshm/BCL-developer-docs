[question?]How would you like to build native video apps for iOS devices?

[intro]
Hi, I'm Matt Boles, a learning specialist at Brightcove. In this video, you will learn about the Player Management API:
*what it is
*and why you would want use it.


[slide]
First, let's understand what we mean by player management in general. By this term we mean tasks you might need to perform on Brightcove Players, for instance:
*creation
*deletion
*editing
*displaying
*publishing
*and other general management tasks.

It is very possible you currently use Studio for these tasks. The difference is the Player Management **API** provides a server side, REST-based API to **programmatically** accomplish those tasks.

Now we have some idea about what the Player Management API, the next question is why would I want to use it? Let's look at a couple of examples of its use:

The first is kind of trivial, but a good introductory management task, that is creating a player. Since this is a REST-based API we will use the https POST method to perform the creation.

The documentation for the Player Management API can be found on the Brightcove Support site.
From the documentation home page, select the quick link for the Player Management API.

On the Player Management API landing page, you will find documentation, including an overview, a quick start, and a guide for how to get the Player Management Key from a player in your Brightcove account.
There is also a complete reference for the API.

Let's look at the Player Management Keys from players document.

Because a Player Management Key is automatically generated when you create a Brightcove Player, you can get the key from the player configuration details.
Keep in mind that Player Management Keys automatically generated for new Brightcove Players are not search-enabled.

Now, let's look at the Quick Start for the Player Management API.

The Quick Start includes a section that explains how to get your credentials needed for accessing the Player Management API.
There is also a sample app for creating a simple Player Management Key.
You can provide your information for Account Id, Client Id and Client Secret, and then create a Player Management Key for your account.

Remember, to perform video searches from the Playback API, you will need a search-enabled Player Management Key.

I am leaving the default input values and selecting the Create the Player Management Key button.
Here, we can see that a new Player Management Key has been created in the Brightcove sample account.

For more details, refer to the Brightcove support documents.
Now, you are ready to experiment on your own with the Player Management API.


By the way, the Player Management API is one of several platform APIs. If you are an API developer, be sure to check out the other Brightcove APIs that are available to you.
