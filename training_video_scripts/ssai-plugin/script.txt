[question?]
Are you frustrated that your video ads do not play when an ad blocker is used in the browser?

Hi, I'm Jeff Doktor, a learning specialist at Brightcove. In this video, you will learn how to stitch server-side ads into your video stream by using the SSAI plugin with the Brightcove Player.

In this video, you will learn how to stitch server-side ads into your video stream by using the SSAI plugin with the Brightcove Player.

Server-side ad insertion, also known as SSAI, allows you to embed ads in your video stream. Since your ad is stitched into your video on the server, you won't have to build separate integrations for each device. It works on any device that supports streaming video.

To get started, you will need a Video Cloud account configured for Dynamic Delivery and enabled for SSAI.

With SSAI auto failover, your client-side ads will play when there is no ad blocker. When an ad blocker is detected, your server-side ads will play.

The benefits of using server-side ads are that they provide a tv-like experience with no delays for downloading ads, they work on all devices, and they can't be blocked by ad blockers in the browser.

First, you want to verify that your ad tag works outside of the player. This ensures that your ad tag is valid and will play without issues. For this video, I am using a VMAP ad URL which defines when ads will play in the video. You can think of a VMAP as a playlist of VAST tags, where each VAST tag is a URL for an individual ad.

In this example, the VMAP is set to play an ad before the video starts, another ad after 5 seconds of video playback and an ad after the video finishes playing. These ads are referred to as pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll ads.

The process of creating an ad and generating an ad tag URL is outside the scope of this video.

If you are not familiar with these ad terms, I recommend that you review the learning guide on video advertising. This document will give you an overview of video advertising terms and show you how to use ads with the Brightcove Player.

Ok, let's get started.

With google's Video Suite Inspector, you can validate that your ad tag functions correctly. I am pasting in my VMAP ad tag URL and selecting the TEST AD button. We can see that the ad starts playing, so we know the ad tag is setup correctly. Now that we know the ad tag is valid, we can configure our player in Video Cloud studio.

[open Players module in Studio]
I am navigating to the Player's module and creating a new player. I am calling it SSAI player.
Next, we'll configure the player for server-side ads.

I am selecting the SSAI player link and selecting Advertising in the left side navigation.

I am selecting server-side advertising and choosing an ad configuration that has been defined for my account.

[home support page > select SSAI product > select SSAI Ad Config API]
You will use the SSAI API to create an ad configuration for an account.
For details, see the SSAI Ad Config API support document.

[return to Studio]
Notice that if you select both client-side and server-side advertising, your player will be set up for ad failover. This means that the Brightcove player will attempt to play your client-side IMA ads. If an ad blocker is detected in the browser, then your server-side ads will play based on your defined ad configuration.

Now, we have configured our player to use server-side ads.
Behind the scenes, the SSAI plugin has been added to our player.

I want to point out that there are additional settings for this plugin that can't be set on this page, but you can configure them manually. For details, see the developer documentation for these options.

I am publishing the player.

I am going to the Media module to publish a video with the SSAI player we just created.

I am selecting the link to view the player. When I start video playback, the pre-roll ad begins to play. When the ad is finished, my video begins playback.

That's all you need to do to configure a player to display server-side ads.

One thing to keep in mind, is that the video creative most be encoded in a format that supports HTML5 playback. If your video ad creative is an FLV file, the ad will not be playable in HTML5 players.
