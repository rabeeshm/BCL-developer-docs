[question?]How would you like to build native video apps for iOS devices?

Hi, I'm Jeff Doktor. In this video, you will be introduced to the Policy API. This API is one of Brightcove's platform APIs, and it allows you to create and view Policy Keys for your account.

The documentation for the Policy API can be found on the Brightcove Support site.

The documentation includes an overview, a quick start, as well as a guide about how to get the Policy Key from a player in your Brightcove account.

There is also a complete reference for the API.
