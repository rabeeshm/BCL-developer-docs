[intro on camera]
Hi, I'm Matt Boles, a learning specialist with Brightcove. In this video, you will learn about the Analytics API:
*what it is
*and why you would want use it.

More specifically, we will start by gaining an understanding of what functionality the Analytics API provides. We will also see common use cases for the API.

Next, we'll see a demonstration that illustrates a vital learning point to understand when using the Analytics API.

Then, we will  move on and view a few samples. The samples demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the API.

Lastly, we will take a quick tour of the Analytics API documentation index page so you can see available resources.

Let's get started with this short introduction.



[slide 1]
The Analytics API allows you to obtain analytics data for your Video Cloud accounts. Data is tracked for, and allows you to query, usage information on the following:
*Your Account
*Videos in your account
*Players created in your account
*Live Streams created in your account

Specific queries can involve MANY of what we call dimensions, which are ways to customize your queries. A small subset of these dimensions is:
*Number of video views
*Date/Time of video views
*Device OS of the viewer
*Browser type
*Location (city/country/region) from which the video is viewed
*Tags associated with videos
*Unique users

Again, this is just a small subset. Also, these dimensions can be combined for very specific queries.




[slide 2]
Although there is an analytics module in Studio, it cannot provide all possible query combinations. Having this server-side, REST-based API provides a way to programmatically access data and have near complete flexibility.

Listed next are some typical use cases for the Analytics API:
*Retrieve data in JSON or CSV format, from which you can create custom charts and displays.
*Use multiple APIs together. For instance, use the Analytics and CMS APIs to create an overlay of the most viewed videos for a specified time period.



[slide 3 - go into Overview doc and select "Dimensions and field"]
This "Dimensions and fields" section of the overview document, which we are now viewing, illustrates a vital learning point in understanding and using the Analytics API. Note that when we select a dimension, like video, it shows the fields on which you can get information. When another dimension is selected, for instance country, the available fields are altered. It is possible, like when selecting the dimensions video and date, nothing can be returned.

ROBERT - DON"T THINK I NEED THIS SENTENCE, WHAT TO YOU THINK? Just FYI, when querying the Analytics API and using a combination that returns no fields, an error is generated.

If you are wondering how to get a certain field back that does not appear under a specific dimension combination, the answer is you can't. The API does not return every field for every dimension or dimension combination. That is why this section of the overview document is so helpful in seeing what is possible.

By the way, all documents and demos we look at during this video will be highlighted later when we look around the Analytics documentation index page.


[in Analytics API Sample: Video Report by Tags]
Here is the first sample. In this sample we can get a report on videos that are tagged with a specified word. We're going to query the default Learning Services account for all the videos that are tagged with the word "bird". Let's get the data returned in CSV format so we can dump it into a spreadsheet. Here, we can see what the actual API request looks like, then when the "Get Analytics Data" button is clicked, the API is queried and the data returned.

*I'll copy the data
*Switch to a spreadsheet
*Paste the data
*Select "DATA then Split to columns"

And there we see the analytics data, including the engagement_score, video ID, number of impressions, and of course the tags, on which the videos were selected.




[in Brightcove Player Sample: Display Views in Controlbar]
The next sample shows the total number of video views in the control bar. The Analytics API is queried for the number of views for a specific video. When the data is returned, it is placed into the control bar.



[in Brightcove Player Sample: Popular Videos Playlist]
This sample uses the Analytics API in conjunction with another another API, in this case, the CMS API. First, the Analytics API is queried and the IDs for the six most popular videos over the last 24 hours are returned. Then the CMS API is called upon to return the video objects for those 6 videos. Finally, a playlist is created with the returned video objects and placed in the player.




[go to Analytics API landing page https://support.brightcove.com/analytics-api from support.brightcove.com]

The last section of this video will be looking over the documentation available for the Analytics API. This documentation can be found from the Brightcove Support site home page. To get to the API's landing page, click the quick link for the Analytics API.

Here we see a list of all the Analytics API documentation, including an overview, a quick start to help you get started using the API, and the complete API reference.

Remember, the "Dimensions and fields" selector information is in the overview. The video report by tags in grouped in the "Analytics API" code samples. The video views in in controlbar and popular videos playlist samples are both in the "Solutions: Brightcove Player + Analytics API" group.

By the way, the Analytics API is one of several platform APIs. If you are an API developer, be sure to check out the other Brightcove APIs that are available.

That's it for this introduction to the Analytics API, thanks for watching!
