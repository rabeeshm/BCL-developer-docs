  <li>Bug fix: Fixed an issue where inactivityTimeout was ignored on mobile/touch devices</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Labels in track button menus should not be forced lower-case</li>
  <li>Bug fix: When fullscreen control is disabled, disable support for double-click to fullscreen</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="6.29.2">VERSION 6 - v6.29.2</h2>

<p>15 Jan 2019</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make players responsive to browser size by default <span class="bcls-highlight"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></span></li>
	<li>Bug Fix: Cleanly dispose of HLS/DASH source handler</li>
	<li>Bug Fix: Resolve an occasional issue where Brightcove Player dropped <code>video_impression</code> and <code>video_view</code> when using the IMA3 plugin v3.x and <code>autoplay</code> on</li>
	<li>Bug Fix: Roll back usage of the sendBeacon API to reverse a 0.1% increase in beaconing failures</li>
	<li>Update to <code>Video.js</code> 7.4.2<span class="bcls-highlight"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span></li>
	<li>Bug Fix: When used with a <code>track</code> tag, the <code>default</code> attribute now functions correctly and starts the captions automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bcls-highlight"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></span>It should be noted that, in this context, making the player "responsive to browser size by default" is distinct from making the player fluid. The following should clarify the new feature:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To be clear: static players will not suddenly become fluid!</li>
	<li>The use of "responsive" in this context means we have enabled the new Video.js responsive option in the Brightcove Player by default (whereas it is off by default in Video.js). This option will cause a <code>vjs-layout-*</code> class to be applied to the player based on a default set of breakpoints whenever the size of the player is changed. This means that the "responsiveness" is not actually based on the browser viewport size, but on the size of the embedded player.</li>
	<li>Two small UI adjustments have been made based on this new Video.js option. It is anticipated these adjustments should not affect many users, if any, but in the interests of completeness, they are in:
	<ul>
		<li>Captions settings dialog</li>
		<li>Social plugin dialog</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Users who have responsive embeds from the Studio or via Video.js' fluid option will be able to take advantage of the new <code>vjs-layout-*</code> classes to improve their player UI customizations based on the player size. And users who have statically-sized embeds will still get a <code>vjs-layout-*</code> class applied to their player, but it won't change unless the size of the player changes at runtime.</li>
  <li>For small width player implementations (like 425px), it is possible that some buttons in the controlbar will be hidden. Although you will loose the responsive features, the following code will prevent the buttons from being hidden:
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">&lt;script&gt;
  videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
    var myPlayer = this;
    myPlayer.responsive(false);
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bcls-highlight"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span>Video.js v7.4.2 includes new functionality for live streaming, including new <strong>Live</strong> text indicator. If you are building a skin from scratch, and using the <code>skin: false</code> attribute, you must include the following CSS to be sure the <strong>Live</strong> indicator does not appear:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-css">.video-js:not(.vjs-live) .vjs-live-control,.video-js.vjs-liveui .vjs-live-control {
  display: none;
}</code></pre>

<h3>5.0.9</h3>

<p>26 Jan 2016</p>

<p>The Brightcove Player version 5 is a major update that includes significant improvements for HLS playback and user customization.</p>

<p>Most users of the Brightcove Player will be automatically updated starting February 8. We recommend automatic updates for most customers to provide the best end-user experience with the latest features and bug fixes. Keeping your player up-to-date also makes it easier for Brightcove support to help when needed.</p>

<p>This table shows how this update will affect customers based on specific features and requirements, and who should opt out of automated updates for now.</p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<p>Brightcove Player version 5 has new support for HLS video without using Flash. In this release, in all browsers that support the Media Source Extensions API (MSE), the Brightcove Player can play HLS videos <strong>without Flash!</strong> That means Flash is not used on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Flash will still be used for older versions of IE but can be disabled by config.</p>

<p>MSE HLS provides several huge benefits:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Videos will load fast and play smoothly, even at high resolutions and high frame rates, <strong>including 4K and 60FPS video - on modest hardware</strong></li>
	<li>It uses approximately <strong>-50% of the CPU load</strong> to render the same videos, meaning batteries will last longer and your laptop fan won￯﾿ﾢ￯ﾾﾀ￯ﾾﾙt turn on</li>
	<li>Power saving and other browser settings to limit the use of Flash will <strong>no longer have any effect on the player</strong> regardless of the player￯﾿ﾢ￯ﾾﾀ￯ﾾﾙs dimensions</li>
</ol>

<p>Other features in this release include:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>New skin</strong> - Based on significant UX research we have built a new skin that incorporates many changes. These include a new, centered big play button, new colors, new seek bar behavior, and a new title bar called the dock. Usability testing participants especially loved the new timeline that expands on hover and makes it easier to seek to a specific time. You can now choose between the default new skin, called Luna, and the old 1.x skin, now called Graphite.</li>
	<li><strong>Initial support for live captions</strong> - this release now supports many 608/708 caption encoding systems. This includes support for the popular pop-on and roll-up methods and basic styling</li>
	<li><strong>Compatibility mode</strong> for all 1.x and Video.js 4.x plugins. (except DASH/DRM, FreeWheel, and OnceUX plugins - updates to follow during Q1)</li>
</ol>

<p>Also in this version, we have made many updates to improve the programming model for customization, including simplifications to our skinning model and the API for plugins. These changes bring us up-to-date with our latest open source release, Video.js 5, <a href="https://blog.videojs.com/post/130143694631/video-js-5">which you can read about here</a>. You will also notice that we have also synchronized our version numbering between Video.js and Brightcove Player releases.</p>
