<h1>Responsive Sizing for Video Players</h1>
        <!-- Place document intro sentence(s) here -->
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">This document applies to the legacy Smart Player - you should probably be looking at <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/brightcove-player/samples/responsive-sizing.html">Responsive Sizing for the Brightcove Player</a> instead!</aside>
        <p>When you embed a video player in a page, you will notice that it does not resize with the browser window. This occurs because, by default, the video player is given a fixed width and height, preventing it from responding to changes in the browser. One aspect of responsive web design is ensuring that elements within your page adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.</p>
        <p>This document focuses on resizing video players according to screen dimensions, while also maintaining the aspect ratio, so that the video is not letterboxed (see image below).</p>
        <div><img src="//img.brightcove.com/node11712-letterbox.png" alt="" /></div>
        <p class="BCL-objective">This document follows a series of learning topics to help you understand the concepts for making your player responsive. Here are the introductory topics:</p>

<!--		  <li>Create a responsive player in HTML mode with HLS videos</li>-->
          <li><a href="#Playlists">Use a single video player with a responsive playlist</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: The samples in this document do not address all the aspects of responsive web design, which might include font changes and whole layout transformations.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="GetStarted" class="section">
        <h2>Get started</h2>
        <p>You will start with the basic Player code embedded in an HTML document. The Player code can be copied from Video Cloud Studio. Here is an example of the Player code:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="eb6728158c0685898451" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="1-39"></code></p>
        <p>To learn more about generating the Brightcove player code, refer to the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/smart-player-api/samples/basic-setup.html">Publishing a Video Cloud Player</a> document.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="IntrinsicRatio" class="section">
        <h2>Use intrinsic ratio</h2>
        <p>In this solution, you will use an intrinsic ratio, which is a CSS technique to fluidly constrain a child element to a ratio set in their parent element. To do this, you will add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container around the video player and set the <code>padding-bottom</code> property with the desired aspect ratio for the video.</p>
        <p>The padding property is the magic that styles a box with an intrinsic ratio. This is because the padding property is set as a percentage of the width of the containing block. It works well since padding styles are supported in all major browsers.</p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: This solution is borrowed from a blog post by Thierry Koblentz. For more details about browser compatibility, refer to his <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video"> blog post</a>.</p>
        <p>Creating a responsive video player consists of the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Add a parent container around the video player and style it with an intrinsic ratio</li>
          <li>Verify the sample code</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Creating a parent container with an intrinsic ratio</h3>
        <p>In your HTML document, add HTML and CSS code to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container around the video player.</li>
          <li>Style the outer container with the <code>padding-bottom</code> property set to a percentage to control its size. The percentage determines the height of
            the element based on its parent's width.</li>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: To determine the percentage for a video with a 16:9 aspect ratio, divide 9 by 16 (i.e. 9/16 = .5625) to get 56.25%. For a 16:9 video, you want the height to be 9/16ths of the width.</p>
          <li>If your video player contains chrome controls, you will also need to specify a fixed-pixel <code>padding-top</code> value for the outer container. This value should equal the height of your player's chrome controls.</li>
          <p class="BCL-aside">This example uses a Chromeless Video Player, so a padding-top value is not required.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><code data-gist-id="eb6728158c0685898451" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="45-77"></code></p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: A text block has been added above and below the video player to demonstrate how the player would appear in a real web page.</p>
        <h3>Running the sample code</h3>
        <p>Run the sample code in the browser. Resize the browser to see how the video player resizes.</p>
        <img src="//img.brightcove.com/node11712_runSampleFW.png" width="650" height="528" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div id="ControlSize" class="section">
        <h2>Control player size</h2>
        <p>Notice that in the previous solution, the video player width extended to the full width of the browser. You can control the width of your player by adding another bounding container.</p>
        <p>Controlling the size of your player consists of the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Add another bounding container around the video player</li>
          <li>Verify the sample code</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Adding  a bounding container</h3>
        <p>In your HTML document, add HTML and CSS code to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container around the <code>outer-container &lt;div&gt;</code> block.</li>
          <li>Style the <code>containing-block</code> container with the<code> width </code>property set to a percentage to control its size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><code data-gist-id="eb6728158c0685898451" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="82-120"></code>

          <h3>Running the sample code</h3>
          <p>Click <a href="http://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/smart-player-api/node11712/resizeCodeChromeless2.html">here</a> to view the complete sample page. Resize the browser to see how the video player resizes. Notice that the video player is only 75% of the width of the browser.</p>
          <img src="//img.brightcove.com/node11712_runSampleNFW.png" width="650" height="402" alt="" />
      </div>

      <div id="CalculateRatio" class="section">
        <h2>Calculate ratio</h2>
        <p>Using a non-standard video size can cause letterboxing. This video has an intrinsic ratio of 53%. Since it does not fit the standard 16:9 aspect ratio (56.25%),it causes letterboxing.</p>
        <img src="//img.brightcove.com/node11712_runCalculate1.png" width="650" height="403" alt="" />
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: You can find the video's width and height in the Brightcove Media module to compute the intrinsic ratio. (i.e. 212/400 = .53 or 53%)</p>
        <img src="//img.brightcove.com/node11712_videoDimensions.png" width="616" height="219" alt="" />
        <p>By using the Smart Player API, you can get the dimensions of the video and set the video size.</p>
        <p>Controlling the size of your player consists of the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Enable your player for ActionScript/JavaScript APIs</li>
          <li>Use the Smart Player API to get the width and height of the video and calculate the percentage for the <code>padding-bottom</code> property</li>
          <li>Verify the sample code</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enabling your player for ActionScript/JavaScript APIs</h4>
        <p>In Video Cloud Studio, make sure you have enabled the player for ActionScript/JavaScript APIs in the Web Settings section.</p>
        <img src="//img.brightcove.com/node11712_playerAPISetting.png" width="488" height="125" alt="" />
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Your custom code for the Player APIs will fail silently if this player setting is not enabled.</p>
        <h3>Calculating the aspect ratio percentage</h4>
        <p>In Video Cloud Studio, make sure you have enabled the player for ActionScript/JavaScript APIs in the Web Settings section.</p>
        <p>In your HTML document, add JavaScript code to access the Player API to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Include the Player API event listeners.</li>
          <li>Create an <code>onTemplateLoad()</code> function that defines the player and the <code>APIModules</code> object.</li>
          <li>Create an <code>onTemplateReady()</code> function that defines the video player and the experience module. Get the width and height for the current video
            rendition and use these values to calculate the intrinsic ratio.</li>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: The <code>getCurrentRendition()</code> method will return a null value if you are using HLS renditions for iOS devices. See the <a href="#HtmlMode">HTML mode</a> section for a more robust solution that works with all rendition types.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><code data-gist-id="eb6728158c0685898451" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="125-204"></code></p>

        <div id="viewport" class="section">
        <h2>Configuring the Viewport</h2>
        <p>By default, mobile devices will render a webpage using a standard desktop width scaled to fit the screen. With a viewport, you can control the page's width and scaling on different devices.</p>
        <p>Follow these links to learn more about the viewport meta tag:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="//developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html">Safari Developer Library - Configuring the Viewport</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/ConfigureViewport">Google Developers - Configure the Viewport</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is an example of a general use viewport tag for a responsive design:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="eb6728158c0685898451" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="283"></code></p>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Using the viewport tag with just a CSS solution may cause your Smart Player to no longer be responsive on mobile devices. If you want to use the viewport tag, you should use a complete solution, like shown in the <a href="#HtmlMode">HTML mode</a> section, to maintain a responsive player.</p>

      </div>

      <div id="HtmlMode" class="section">
        <h2>HTML mode</h2>
        <p>When Flash is not supported (like on iOS devices and many Android devices), the Smart Player will use HTML mode for video playback. So, this solution describes how to make your Smart Player responsive primarily for mobile devices.</p>
        <p>When in HTML mode, your video plays in a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag wrapped inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element. In this section, you will learn how to resize a video contained in an iframe.</p>
        <p>Using a parent container with the intrinsic ratio while in HTML mode, you will notice that the player container resizes but the actual video does not.</p>
        <div><img src="assets/responsive-html1.png" alt="Responsive HTML Player1" /></div>
        <p>To resize your video in HTML mode, you must change the size of the iframe. You can do this by using the <code>setSize()</code> method.</p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">A small coding enhancement was added to this document to be sure the solution works with the all versions of Chrome. An issue became apparent on Chrome version 35.0.1916.114+ and Flash 13.0.0.214 (Internal "Pepper")+. The enhancement ensures the the <code>setSize()</code> method is only called in HTML mode.</p>
        <p>Use the Smart Player API as follows to resize your player in HTML mode:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>For non-HLS renditions, use the rendition DTO to calculate the intrinsic ratio.</li>
          <li>For HLS renditions, use the media event object to calculate the intrinsic ratio.</li>
          <li>Use the experience module's <code>setSize()</code> method to reset the size of the player.</li>
          <li>Verify the sample code</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This solution, requires access to the Brightcove Player API.</p>

        <h3>Resetting the iframe size</h3>
        <p>In Video Cloud Studio, make sure you have enabled the player for ActionScript/JavaScript APIs in the Web Settings section.</p>
        <p>In your HTML document, add JavaScript code to access the Player API to do the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Include the <code>forceHTML</code> player parameter to force HTML mode.</li>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: The forceHTML parameter should only be used for testing.</p>
          <li>Include the Player API event listeners.</li>
          <li>Create an <code>onTemplateLoad()</code> function that defines the player and the <code>APIModules</code> object.</li>
          <li>Create an <code>onTemplateReady()</code> function that defines the video player and the experience module. Notice that this solution calls the <code>getCurrentRendition()</code> method on the <code>videoPlayer</code> object.</li>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: The <code>getCurrentRendition()</code> method will return a null value if you are using an HLS video rendition. This is because the HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element can not determine which rendition in an HLS manifest is currently selected and playing.</p>
            <p>Check the response from the <code>getCurrentRendition()</code> method call:</p>
            <ol type=a>
                <li>If the response is an object, calculate the new intrinsic ratio based on the rendition DTO's <code>frameHeight</code> and <code>frameWidth</code> properties.</li>
                <li>If the response is a null value, use the media event object to retreive the player height and width. You can use any media event as defined in the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/smart-player-api/references/symbols/brightcove.api.events.MediaEvent.html">Smart Player API Reference</a> document. We are using the <code>PLAY</code> event which is triggered when the video begins or resumes playback. Calculate the new intrinsic ratio based on the first rendition's <code>frameHeight</code> and <code>frameWidth</code> properties.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: This solution will not work properly if the first HLS rendition is an audio-only rendition, since the width and height will not reflect the size of the video. When creating HLS renditions it is best practice to start with the lowest non-audio rendition. For more information, see the <a href="//support.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/docs/delivering-videos-apple-hls">Delivering Videos with Apple HLS</a> document.</p>
          <li>Create an <code>window.onresize()</code> function that gets the computed width and height for the video player. These values are passed to the experience module's <code>setSize()</code> method to resize the iframe. The method is only called when the player is in HTML mode, as calling it in Flash mode causes issues when the video is made full screen.</li>
          <li>Programmatically dispatch a <code>window.resize</code> event. This causes the <code>onresize</code> method to be called on application startup. This must be done or on startup the iframe will not be the correct size. The last three lines of code of the onTemplateReady event handler use JavaScript to perform this task.</li>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Use the <code>id</code> value in the <code>object</code> tag for your player to get the computed width and height values.</p>
        </ol>

          <h2>Responsive Playlist</h2>
          <p>Using a playlist player might not always be the best option. A single video player with playlists in HTML mode may provide a more flexible solution. We start with a single video player and then get the playlist data transfer object (DTO) from the Smart Player API to build the playlist.</p>
          <p>This sample uses the parent containers and the intrisic ratio to resize the player when in Flash mode. When in HTML mode, it uses the experience module's <code>setSize()</code> method to resize the player. See the samples above for details on how to do this.</p>
          <p>The playlist DTO gives us all the information that we need to build an HTML list of video objects. When the user selects a video object in the playlist, either the <code>loadVideoByID()</code> or the <code>cueVideoByID()</code > method is called with the video id.</p>
          <p>Since we are building the playlist manually, we have complete control over how we want it to resize. In this example, the number of video objects that display in a row changes as the width of the browser resizes. This is done using the CSS <code>float</code> property. </p>
