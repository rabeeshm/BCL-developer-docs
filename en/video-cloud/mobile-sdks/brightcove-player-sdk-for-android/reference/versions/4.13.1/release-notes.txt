Version 4.1.22:

  SDK changes:

    * Modified the VideoDisplayComponent to no longer call
      MediaPlayer.setDisplay(null) when destroying the playing,
      because we've seen this hang on some devices with some content,
      like Widevine.

  FreeWheel Plugin changes:

    * Changed default submissionTimeout from 3 to 30 seconds.

  HLS Player changes:

    * Modified SeamlessVideoDisplayComponent to turn off the video
      stream for the prebuffering player earlier during

      loads, the asynchronous call could be delayed and a bit of audio
      from the next video could be heard.

Version 4.1.21:

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Modified the GoogleIMAVideoAdPlayer to listen for SEEK_TO events
      and suppress reporting progress until playback has progressed at
      lesat 1 second.  This prevents all the accumulated midrolls from
      piling up and being played when slowly scrubbing to the end of a
      video.

      captioning for the current playing video.

    * Added uniqueId, type, and message properties to DRM events.

Version 4.1.19:

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed issue where when starting playback from a non-zero
      position, playback would skip back to that non-zero position
      after the first ad finished.  This was a side effect of the fix
      in 4.1.18.

Version 4.1.18:

  IMA Plugin changes:

      using Ad Rules.

    * Fixed issue where the onResume() callback was called instead
      onPlay() when ads began playback.

  OnceUx Plugin changes:

    * Deprecated the two URI processVideo() method in favor of a
      single URI interface.

    * Updated the VisualOn libvossl_OSMP library, which includes an
      update to the OpenSSL library from version 0.9.8m to version
      0.9.8za.

    * The .aar file now has the .so files in the jni/armeabi folder
      instead of in the armeabi.jar, which was a workaround and
      support for the workaroudn was recently removed from the Android
      Gradle Build Tools.

    * Updated to emit DID_INTERRUPT_CONTENT and DID_RESUME_CONTENT.

Version 4.1.14:

      WILL_INTERRUPT_CONTENT and WILL_RESUME_CONTENT event listeners
      complete.

    * Added getEventLogger() to the BrightcovePlayer class.

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed issue with extra PAUSE and RESUME tracking events at the
      beginning of each ad break.

    * Fixed issue with video auto playing when the Ad Rules URL failed
      to load.

    * Added support for overriding the voVidDec.dat and cap.xml
      files.  For example:

        SeamlessVideoDisplayComponent.voVidDecDatFileName = "voVidDec.orig.dat";
        SeamlessVideoDisplayComponent.capXmlFileName = "cap.orig.xml";

    * Added logging of all seamless events.

Version 2.2.2:

  SDK changes:

    * Removed Serializable requirement for Event properties.
    * Added checks for an invalid surface.
    * HttpService now supports headers and JSON GET and POST requests.
    * Fixed design view issue with setAppName().
    * Added "start" and "end" properites to CUE_POINT events.
    * Added logic to ignore PLAY events while handling a CUE_POINT event.
    * Added handling for a null window.
    * Modified CUE_POINT behavior such that the player isn't
      automatically paused.  Cue point handlers should emit a PAUSE
      event if necessary.

    * Fixed bug where BrightcoveVideoView would not maintain the correct aspect ratio
      of the video.
    * Fixed crash on Kindle Fire if you touch the BrightcoveVideoView before content
      has been loaded.

    * DID_SEEK no longer emitted after resuming playback
    * RTMP urls from the MediaSurface no longer have their delivery type set incorrectly
      as MP4.  They are now UNKNOWN.
    * Emitting a Event.SET_SOURCE event with a source with no url will now emit a
      SOURCE_NOT_FOUND event.

  SDK changes:

    * Catalog pulls sources from the WVMRenditions video field from Media API response.

Version 2.0.1:

      subsequent videos in a playlist.
    * Fixed numerous bugs related to autoplay of subsequent videos in a playlist.
    * Fixed replay bug with last video in a playlist.

      fill_parent, and exact dimensions.
    * Added localization support for error messages.
    * Added support for calling play before DID_SET_SOURCE.

  SDK Open issues:

    * Seeking with HLS videos sometimes fails.  Android's VideoView has the same behavior.

Version 1.0.0:

  HLS Player Open Issues:

    * Intermittent crashes due to fatal signals.  We are still looking
      for reproducible test cases.

  Freewheel Plugin Open Issues:

    * Midrolls with HLS videos are not supported due to an Android
      bug.  The underlying Android MediaPlayer for the main video
      throws an error when resumed after the midroll.

  IMA Plugin Open Issues:

    * Midrolls with HLS videos are not supported due to an Android
      bug.  The underlying Android MediaPlayer for the main video
      throws an error when resumed after the midroll.
