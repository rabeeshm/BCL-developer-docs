<p class="p1"><b>Overview</b></p>
<p class="p2">To request Cathy access tokens in OAuth flows other than the client credentials flow, the request must be made against a registered <i>client app</i>.&nbsp; This is a record describing the application for whose consumption the token is being requested, and there is an API in Cathy to create and manipulate these client app registrations.</p>
<p class="p2">(Technically, token requests in the client credentials flow are made against a registered client app also, namely the client whose credentials are being presented; but the authentication flow and criteria are so different that we treat them separately.&nbsp; Internally, client credentials are almost but not entirely the same thing as client app registrations.)</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Client app registration data</b></p>
<p class="p2">Client app registrations have the following fields.&nbsp; All of them except <b>redirect_url</b> and <b>trusted</b> also appear on client credentials.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>client_id</b> (UUID, issued at creation time):&nbsp; Identifies the client app registration.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>client_secret</b> (base64-encoded bit string, issued at creation time and never disclosed thereafter):&nbsp; For <i>untrusted</i> app registrations (see below for definitions), this secret is used to make changes to the app registration.&nbsp; For <i>trusted</i> registrations, the secret is irrelevant.&nbsp; (For client credentials, this is used to authenticate token requests against the client.)</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>type</b> (string, constant, issued at creation time):&nbsp; Equal to "app_registration" for client app registrations.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>name</b> (string, <i>required</i> at creation time):&nbsp; A short name used to identify this client app to users.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>description</b> (string, <i>required</i> at creation time):&nbsp; A longer text used to identify and describe this client app to users.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>privilege_level</b> (integer, issued at creation or update time): An internal number describing how "sensitive" this registration is and thus what API endpoints may be used to manipulate it.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>issued_to</b> (string, issued at creation time):&nbsp; A string designating the entity to whom this client app registration was issued; if it was issued based on a BC_TOKEN authentication, the value is the MaitreD email address of the BC_TOKEN's user.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>issued_user</b> (integer, issued at creation time):&nbsp; An integer designating the entity to whom this client app registration was issued; if it was issued based on a BC_TOKEN authentication, the value is the MaitreD user ID of the BC_TOKEN's user.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>issued_at</b> (timestamp, issued at creation time):&nbsp; Time of issuance of the client registration.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>expires_at</b> (timestamp, <i>optional argument</i> at creation or update time, defaults to nil):&nbsp; Time after which the client registration will no longer be considered valid.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>maximum_scope</b> (scope, <i>required</i> at creation time):&nbsp; Maximum scope of an access token issued against this client registration.&nbsp; See "Registration authorization" below for how this scope parameter is interpreted and what authentication credentials must be presented to justify the maximum scope.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>revoked</b> (boolean, set only by DELETE requests, cannot be unset):&nbsp; True if this client registration has been revoked (is no longer valid).</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>redirect_url</b> (string, <i>required</i> at creation time):&nbsp; The OAuth redirect URL where access tokens will be sent; see the OAuth2 standard for the intended semantics. Must use https protocol.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>trusted</b> (boolean, <i>required</i> at creation time):&nbsp; See "Trusted and untrusted registrations" below for interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Thus, the required arguments for a client app registration create operation are <b>name</b>, <b>description</b>, <b>maximum_scope</b>, <b>redirect_url</b>, and <b>trusted</b>, and in addition <b>expires_at</b> may be specified.&nbsp; All these fields except for <b>trusted</b> may be updated by a PUT request.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Trusted and untrusted registrations</b></p>
<p class="p2">A client app registration is either <i>trusted</i> or <i>untrusted</i>.&nbsp; The difference, from the user's point of view, is that before we are willing to issue an access token for consumption by an untrusted app, we must have a record that the user has explicitly chosen to trust the app – we present a page something like the Facebook "Allow this app access to your account?&nbsp; It wants blah-de-blah" page, and record the user's assent.&nbsp; For trusted app registrations we do not require this additional step.&nbsp; Trusted app registrations are for use by Brightcove's own apps; untrusted registrations are for third-party apps.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Registration authorization</b></p>
<p class="p2">The<b> </b>mechanics of authorization for client app registration requests differ between trusted and untrusted registrations, because trusted registrations confer the right to interpret user authentication credentials into tokens with real force, and untrusted registrations do not, at least not without explicit assent by the user.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">To create, view, update, or revoke a <i>trusted</i> client app registration, you must present authorization credentials sufficient to authorize the maximum scope (see&nbsp;<a href="//confluence.vidmark.local/display/DEV/Scope+authorization"><span class="s1">Scope authorization</span></a>), exactly as if you were creating a client credential; and the restriction of API endpoint based on privilege level is enforced.</li>
  <li class="li3">To create an <i>untrusted</i> client app registration, no credentials whatsoever are required.&nbsp; To view, update, or revoke an untrusted client app registration, you must present its client ID and secret as HTTP Basic authentication parameters, exactly as if you were requesting an access token against a client credential.&nbsp; For untrusted app registrations, the restriction of API endpoint based on privilege level is not enforced.&nbsp; (Rationale:&nbsp; We want it to be possible for third parties to request client app registrations with maximum scopes covering all accounts, which each user will interpret into their own account by making a trust assertion.&nbsp; Normally the privilege level restriction would prohibit registering such a strong scope except through the private API.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">In practice, a useful client app registration has maximum scope with a blanket identity such as "all video cloud accounts" on it.&nbsp; Scopes of this sort are subject to two restrictions:&nbsp; they must be accessed through the <i>private</i> API endpoint, and you must authenticate with your LDAP (login.arc) username and password, since no BC_TOKEN authentication will authorize all Video Cloud accounts at once.&nbsp; (Cathy doesn't know what to do with wacky tokens yet.)</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="p2">Suppose you want to register a client app that will ask for tokens with the operation tag "video-cloud/player/read" on any Video Cloud account.&nbsp; To register the client, do something like the following (where whitespace and comments should be ignored):</p>
<p class="p2"><b>XXX In QA environments the "cacert.pem" below is not actually the QA root cert right now – it is a Cathy self-signed cert.&nbsp; For the moment use -k or --insecure to disable CA cert verification in QA.&nbsp; We will update this document when this is fixed – as a general rule we do not want to encourage you to use -k. XXX</b></p>

<p class="p2">This will challenge you for your login.arc password (as part of the HTTP Basic authentication you supplied with --user) and also a passphrase for the client certificate.&nbsp; Contact Team Cathy for help getting the client cert authentication working.&nbsp; If everything goes well, you will get back a blob of JSON containing a client ID and client secret and some other things.&nbsp; Save the client ID, but don't worry about the client secret; because your app registration is trusted, you will need to authenticate in exactly this way every time you read or update the app registration, and your secret is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="p2">Say the client ID you got back from this call was c29c66c4-5341-4d16-ac19-49e99f84ae7.&nbsp; You could then request an access token in the implicit flow like this:</p>
