<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="unique%20user%20tracking.html">Unique user tracking</a></span><span class="s3"> </span>feature is useful in identifying the number of unique browsers ( which may roughly equate to actual unique users ) sending events. This means if the same browser was to send 2 <span class="s4">video_view</span> events, they would be recorded as a single unique entity.</p>
<p class="p2">The users can be tracked by two means:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li3">A Server side browser cookie</li>
  <li class="li3">Client side unique identifier</li>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Opt-in</b></p>
<p class="p2">User tracking is enabled only when the <span class="s4">_track</span> parameter is set to any value other than <span class="s4">false</span>. This includes the case where no value is set, ie, if the player sends an event with <span class="s4">_track=</span>, we would still not track the user.</p>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Server side identifier cookie</b></p>
<p class="p2">This is the most common and simplest use case. If the player sends a request to the analytics collector with the <span class="s4">_track</span> flag set. The server will generate a cookie with name <span class="s4">_bc</span> and value set to a <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt"><span class="s3">UUID</span></a>. This cookie would be set with a <span class="s4">max-age</span> of 365 days after which a new cookie would be set.</p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li3">The max age of the cookie is reset on every visit to 365 days.</li>
  <li class="li3">If the tracking is disabled (by sending <span class="s4">_track=false</span>) the collector would simply not continue to set/reset cookies. This implies that the cookies that are already set would continue to exist on the viewer's browser until they are cleared.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Client side identifier</b></p>
<p class="p3">In certain cases, such as native mobile apps or certain browsers (cookies disabled), it may be difficult or impossible to accept/set/store cookies. In this scenario, the user/client application may create a unique identifier (such as a device UUID) and send it as a the <span class="s4">user_id</span> query parameter.</p>
