        <p>Note that every 1-2 weeks pre-released versions become the current version. At that time all non-locked players are upgraded to the current version.

        <h2>Features for v2.3.5</h2>
        <h4>Notable features in this release include:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure Video.js 4 compatibility is active for players created using the <code>bc()</code> function.</li>
          <li>Upgrade to video.js 5.1.0.</li>

          <li>Improve HTML5-HLS live playback behavior.</li>
        </ul>

      <div id="features502" class="section">
        <h2>Features for v5.0.3</h2>
        <p>Now available as an official pre-release is version 5.0.3, which is the latest Brightcove Player to incorporate Video.js 5. We have updated the version numbering so that the major version of the Brightcove Player matches the version of Video.js that it is based on. 5.0.3 will be the successor to 1.14.x for all unlocked players in the next update cycle in the next few days. No action is required to receive this update.</p>
        <p>This version has minor updates to HLS reliability since 5.0.2 and has been extensively tested for backward compatibility with 1.14 players and page customizations.</p>
        <p>Please see previous notices below about version 5 changes. Among the more significant changes is the introduction of a new HLS implementation based on Media Source Extensions. This allows playback of HLS video without Flash on most newer browsers, including recent versions Firefox and Chrome. Flash HLS fallback is still provided for browsers without MSE, such as IE 11 on Windows 7. The Brightcove Player uses native HLS playback where available, notably on Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge.</p>
        <p>Pages that include the following plugins will be excluded from the initial update. If you are using these plugins please make sure your players have been locked (described here):<p>
        <ul>
          <li>FreeWheel</li>
          <li>OnceUX</li>
          <li>DASH/DRM</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These plugins will be updated in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Here is the curl command to use the v5.0.3 player without the new skin, where you substitute appropriate values for <strong>YOUR_EMAIL</strong>, <strong>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</strong> and <strong>YOUR_PLAYER_ID</strong>. If you want a 5.0.3 player with the new skin use the curl statement in the next section, <strong>Try new version</strong>.</p>
        <pre><code>curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{
      "player": {
        "template": {
          "version": "5.0.3"
        }
      },
      "skin": "graphite",
      "compatibility": true
  }' \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/configuration</code></pre>      </div>

      <div id="tryit" class="section">
        <h2>Try new version</h2>
        <p>To test the new version you must manually update a player using a curl statement. An quick overview of curl can be found at the top of the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/player-management/getting-started/player-mgmt-quick-start.html">Quick Start to Player Management</a>. In the document there is a specific section on how to <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/player-management/getting-started/player-mgmt-quick-start.html#updatePlayer">update your player</a>.</p>
        <p>Here is the curl command to update your player, where you substitute appropriate values for <strong>YOUR_EMAIL</strong>, <strong>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</strong> and <strong>YOUR_PLAYER_ID</strong>.</p>
        <pre><code>curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{
      "player": {
        "template": {
          "version": "5.0.3"
        }
      }
  }' \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/configuration</code></pre>
        <p>In most cases you will want to publish the player, which can be done with the following curl statement. Again, you will need to substitute correct values where indicated.</p>
        <pre><code>curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL  \
  --request POST \

        <h2>Features for v5.0.2</h2>
        <p>If you've been following early-access builds so far, you may be wondering what happened to v3 and v4. Don't worry, you didn't miss anything! To keep things simple, we've decided to bump up our major version to match the major version of Video.js being used. So one day when you're using Brightcove Player v7.14.1, you'll know it's based on video.js v7.x.x. Other than the big, arbitrary version change, here are the highlights from this release:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Update to video.js 5.4.5 Patch an issue with player sizing in I</li>E8
          <li>Add more compatibility support for customizations that use video.js 4.x APIs</li>
          <li>Fix issues with the new dock component</li>
          <li>Prefer HLS on IE11/Win7, even though HTML5 HLS is not available</li>
          <li>Support more streams with HTML5-HLS</li>
          <li>Ensure "autoplay" specified in the embed code overrides player configuration settings</li>
          <li>Remove current time and duration from the control bar for live videos with the 5.x skin</li>
          <li>Remove some deprecation warnings</li>
          <li>Address issues with the compatibility option and reloading player scripts multiple times</li>
        </ul>
      </div>



      <div id="features235" class="section">
        <h2>Features for v2.3.5</h2>
        <p>This update to the early-access build of the Brightcove Player allows you to use your existing player's look-and-feel! It introduces two new player configuration parameters that you can adjust:</p>
        <pre><code>skin: "graphite"</code></pre>
        <p>This setting allows you to select the older-style Brightcove Player skin instead of the new default look. If you enable this option, you will also need to make sure video.js 4 compatibility is active.</p>
        <pre><code>compatibility: true</code></pre>
        <p>Adds a compatibility layer for video.js 4 that re-introduces a number of properties and methods that were deprecated or removed in video.js 5. If you have deep functionality or style customizations, this ensures your player works identically before and after the upgrade. You can remove this layer once your customizations have been checked against video.js 5.</p>
        <p>Here is the curl command to use the v2.3.5 player without the new skin, where you substitute appropriate values for <strong>YOUR_EMAIL</strong>, <strong>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</strong> and <strong>YOUR_PLAYER_ID</strong>.</p>
        <pre><code>curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{
      "player": {
        "template": {
          "version": "2.3.5"
        }
      },
      "skin": "graphite",
      "compatibility": true
  }' \

<p>Note: Brightcove is shifting to making IE8 support an optional player component unless you have the compatibility flag set. Many of you have already decided that IE8 is not a meaningful portion of your audience and have cleaned up the hacks and workarounds on your sites necessary to keep it limping along. Now, you can opt-out of those kludges in the Brightcove Player as well: if you flip off the compatibility flag, you'll get rid of IE8-specific player shims. That doesn't mean you're out of luck if you do want to use the new skin with IE8 support, though. The standard iframe embed remains IE8-compatible out-of-the-box. The in-page embed has always required tweaks in the head of the document to enable IE8 support. In addition to the video-element-priming that was previously necessary, you will also need a shim for ES5 support. Brightcove has packaged both of those steps up for this release into a convenient script if you don't have ES5 support in your page already:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;!-- If you'd like to support IE8 without the rest of video.js 4 compatibility: --&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/ie8/1.1.0/videojs-ie8.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 &lt;!-- ... --&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>

        <h2>Features for v2.1.3</h2>
        <p>These notable features in this release have not yet been rolled into a current release:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HLS without Flash using MSE on Chrome</strong> - In this release HLS is implemented using Media Source Extensions (MSE). This reduces CPU overhead dramatically (roughly 50%).</li>
          <li><strong>New Skin</strong> - We have updated the player skin with a new look and feel. This will become the default skin for new players at some point. Between now and then we will also provide the original skin and allow publishers to choose. Existing players will eventually be upgraded to the new player version with the original skin.</li>
          <li><strong>Video.js 5.0 Release Version</strong> - This version is based on the now released version of the Video.js 5.0 player. <a href="http://blog.videojs.com/post/130143694631/video-js-5">Details available here.</a></li>
          <li><strong>Plug-in compatibility</strong> - Video.js 5.0 has some changes to the plug-in interface. This version of the Brightcove Player includes a plug-in compatibility shim that allows existing Brightcove Player plug-ins (including those written for Video.js 4.x) to work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Known Issues:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flash-based HLS</strong> - Flash-based HLS is still used on some browsers such as Firefox, and is working in this release with some minor limitations. In particular it does not currently support timed metadata (ID3 tags). You may also observe intermittent quality anomalies with the Flash HLS implementation in this release.</li>
          <li><strong>Plug-ins</strong> should be thoroughly tested with this release since changes have been made to the plug-in interface, even though we have included our new plug-in compatibility shim.</li>
        </ul>
