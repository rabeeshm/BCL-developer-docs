        <h4>Notable features in this release include:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure Video.js 4 compatibility is active for players created using the <code>bc()</code> function.</li>

        <h2>Features for v2.3.5</h2>
        <p>This update to the early-access build of the Brightcove Player allows you to use your existing player's look-and-feel! It introduces two new player configuration parameters that you can adjust:</p>
        <pre><code>skin: "graphite"</code></pre>
        <p>This setting allows you to select the older-style Brightcove Player skin instead of the new default look. If you enable this option, you will also need to make sure video.js 4 compatibility is active.</p>
        <pre><code>compatibility: true</code></pre>
        <p>Adds a compatibility layer for video.js 4 that re-introduces a number of properties and methods that were deprecated or removed in video.js 5. If you have deep functionality or style customizations, this ensures your player works identically before and after the upgrade. You can remove this layer once your customizations have been checked against video.js 5.</p>
        <p>Here is the curl command to use the v2.3.5 player without the new skin, where you substitute appropriate values for <strong>YOUR_EMAIL</strong>, <strong>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</strong> and <strong>YOUR_PLAYER_ID</strong>.</p>
        <pre><code>curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{
      "player": {
        "template": {
          "version": "2.3.5"
        }
        "skin": "graphite",
        "compatibility": true
      }
  }' \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/configuration</code></pre>

<p>Note: Brightcove is shifting to making IE8 support an optional player component unless you have the compatibility flag set. Many of you have already decided that IE8 is not a meaningful portion of your audience and have cleaned up the hacks and workarounds on your sites necessary to keep it limping along. Now, you can opt-out of those kludges in the Brightcove Player as well: if you flip off the compatibility flag, you'll get rid of IE8-specific player shims. That doesn't mean you're out of luck if you do want to use the new skin with IE8 support, though. The standard iframe embed remains IE8-compatible out-of-the-box. The in-page embed has always required tweaks in the head of the document to enable IE8 support. In addition to the video-element-priming that was previously necessary, you will also need a shim for ES5 support. Brightcove has packaged both of those steps up for this release into a convenient script if you don't have ES5 support in your page already:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;!-- If you'd like to support IE8 without the rest of video.js 4 compatibility: --&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;//vjs.zencdn.net/ie8/1.1.0/videojs-ie8.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 &lt;!-- ... --&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>

        <h2>Features for v2.2.0</h2>
        <h4>These notable features in this release have not yet been rolled into a current release::</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure Video.js 4 compatibility is active for players created using the <code>bc()</code> function.</li>
          <li>Upgrade to video.js 5.1.0.</li>
          <li>Expand HTML5-HLS support to more content.</li>
          <li>Improve HTML5-HLS live playback behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

       <div id="features213" class="section">
        <h2>Features for v2.1.3</h2>
        <p>These notable features in this release have not yet been rolled into a current release:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HLS without Flash using MSE on Chrome</strong> - In this release HLS is implemented using Media Source Extensions (MSE). This reduces CPU overhead dramatically (roughly 50%).</li>
          <li><strong>New Skin</strong> - We have updated the player skin with a new look and feel. This will become the default skin for new players at some point. Between now and then we will also provide the original skin and allow publishers to choose. Existing players will eventually be upgraded to the new player version with the original skin.</li>
          <li><strong>Video.js 5.0 Release Version</strong> - This version is based on the now released version of the Video.js 5.0 player. <a href="http://blog.videojs.com/post/130143694631/video-js-5">Details available here.</a></li>
          <li><strong>Plug-in compatibility</strong> - Video.js 5.0 has some changes to the plug-in interface. This version of the Brightcove Player includes a plug-in compatibility shim that allows existing Brightcove Player plug-ins (including those written for Video.js 4.x) to work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Known Issues:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flash-based HLS</strong> - Flash-based HLS is still used on some browsers such as Firefox, and is working in this release with some minor limitations. In particular it does not currently support timed metadata (ID3 tags). You may also observe intermittent quality anomalies with the Flash HLS implementation in this release.</li>
          <li><strong>Plug-ins</strong> should be thoroughly tested with this release since changes have been made to the plug-in interface, even though we have included our new plug-in compatibility shim.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>


 			<div id="tryit" class="section">
				<h2>Try new version</h2>
				<p>To test the new version you must manually update a player using a curl statement. An quick overview of curl can be found at the top of the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/player-management/getting-started/player-mgmt-quick-start.html">Quick Start to Player Management</a>. In the document there is a specific section on how to <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/player-management/getting-started/player-mgmt-quick-start.html#updatePlayer">update your player</a>.</p>
				<p>Here is the curl command to update your player, where you substitute appropriate values for <strong>YOUR_EMAIL</strong>, <strong>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</strong> and <strong>YOUR_PLAYER_ID</strong>.</p>
				<pre><code>curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{
      "player": {
        "template": {
          "version": "2.3.5"
        }
      }
  }' \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/configuration</code></pre>
        <p>In most cases you will want to publish the player, which can be done with the following curl statement. Again, you will need to substitute correct values where indicated.</p>
        <pre><code>curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL  \
  --request POST \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/publish</code></pre>
