      <section id="Common_error_messages" class="bcls-section">
        <h2>Common error messages</h2>
        <p>
          Below is a list of error messages which you might receive when trying to play videos, along with suggested steps to try to fix the problem:
        </p>
        <h3>MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Error code:</strong> 1
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Headline:</strong> The video download was cancelled
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Message:</strong> You aborted the media playback
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Possible cause</h4>
        <p>
          A somewhat generic browser error that indicates that something stopped the video download process in its tracks. This could be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An issue with the computer, such as a crash or interruption to the network service
          </li>
          <li>
            A browser problem, or a configuration issue
          </li>
          <li>
            The browser is not supported, or currently lacks support for video
          </li>
          <li>
            A firewall, web proxy, or network issue is blocking the video download when the browser tries to play it
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps to try</h4>
        <p>
          Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Refresh the page
          </li>
          <li>
            Try an alternative browser
          </li>
          <li>
            If using Internet Explorer, check the version of Flash installed in your browser. An easy way to check is to visit this website: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Flash is required for all versions of Internet Explorer except for Edge
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Error code:</strong> 2
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Headline:</strong> The video connection was lost, please confirm you're connected to the internet
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Message:</strong> A network error caused the media download to fail part-way
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Possible cause</h4>
        <p>
          Here are some possible causes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A firewall blocking the video data
          </li>
          <li>
            A web proxy interrupting the connection or filtering traffic
          </li>
          <li>
            Filtering software (such as Sophos, or Lightspeed Web Filter blocking content)
          </li>
          <li>
            A general network failure (for example, the internet connection to your home/school/personal computer fails)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps to try</h4>
        <p>
          Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check that the internet is working correctly on the affected machine
          </li>
          <li>
            Refresh the page, which can restart a connection that may have dropped
          </li>
          <li>
            Try another video. Does that work? If not, it suggests that content as a whole cannot be reached.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MEDIA_ERR_DECODE</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Error code:</strong> 3
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Headline:</strong> The video is bad or in a format that can't be played on your browser
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Message:</strong> The media playback was aborted due to a corruption problem or because the media used features your browser did not support
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Possible cause</h4>
        <p>
          A browser being unable to play back the requested content. This can happen during playback, or more likely, at or towards the beginning.
        </p>
        <h4>Steps to try</h4>
        <p>
          Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If using Internet Explorer, check the version of Flash installed in your browser. An easy way to check is to visit this website: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Flash is required for all versions of Internet Explorer except for Edge
          </li>
          <li>
            Refresh the page, which may re-download a piece of content that failed to play back due to a partial download on the first try.
          </li>
          <li>
            Update your browser to the latest version. Chrome and Firefox should prompt you with updates, but it is useful to check.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Error code:</strong> 4
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Headline:</strong> This video is either unavailable or not supported in this browser
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Message:</strong> The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Possible cause</h4>
        <p>
          A browser being unable to play back the requested content due to it being unavailable, or cannot be played in this particular browser. It differs from error 3 in that playback fails before it begins, rather than during playback.
        </p>
        <h4>Steps to try</h4>
        <p>
          Check the version of Flash installed in your browser. An easy way to check is to visit this website: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest version of Flash is required for all versions of Internet Explorer except for Edge.
If you are using Internet Explorer, it is essential that it is not running in “Compatibility” or “Enterprise” mode, and that the rendering mode is set to be the same version as the version actually running. Some versions of IE will describe this as Edge mode - if you see that mode listed, that’s the correct one to choose. Having either of these set incorrectly may break playback, cause incorrect behaviour, or prevent the player from working at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, both of these settings will be correct, but may have been specifically set by your IT team.
        </p>

        <h3>PLAYER_ERR_TIMEOUT</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Error code:</strong> -2
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Headline:</strong> Could not download the video
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Message:</strong> Could not download the video
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The player is unable to play back content / buffers for 45 seconds
        </p>
        <h4>Possible cause</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Insufficient bandwidth / network speed
          </li>
          <li>
            A firewall blocking the video data
          </li>
          <li>
            A web proxy interrupting the connection or filtering traffic
          </li>
          <li>
            Filtering software (such as Sophos, or Lightspeed Web Filter blocking content)
          </li>
          <li>
            A general network failure (for example, the internet connection to your home/school/personal computer fails)
          </li>
          <li>
            At times, it can be caused by player specific bugs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps to try</h4>
        <p>
          Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check that the internet is working correctly on the affected machine
          </li>
          <li>
            Refresh the page, which can restart a connection that may have dropped
          </li>
          <li>
            Try another video. Does that work? If not, it suggests that content as a whole cannot be reached.
          </li>
          <li>
            Does the issue always happen at the point in time?
          </li>
