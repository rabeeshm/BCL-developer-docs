          <h2>Adding callbacks</h2>
          <p>You can use callback URLs with any batch provisioning job. With the new Video Cloud orchestration system, the procedure is the same, but the callback messages contain more information, particularly if errors are encountered in processing the job.</p>
          <p>To use the callback feature, include a &lt;callback&gt; element in the manifest file for your FTP batch upload. The &lt;callback&gt; element is a child of the top-level publisher-upload-manifest element. It has a single attribute, entity-url, whose value is the URL you want the upload status posted to.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;publisher-upload-manifest publisher-id="57838016001" preparer="Robert Crooks" report-success="true"&gt;
  <strong>&lt;callback entity-url="http://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/batch/callbacks/batch-callback.php"/&gt;</strong>

            <p>Note the both <code>http:</code> and <code>https:</code> are supported for the callback URL.</p>
            <p>Also note that HTTP callback endpoints must return HTTP 200 if the request was ok. Other "success" codes such as HTTP 202 are not supported by our callback system.</p>
          </div>
          <p>You will receive notification only of failures, not successes, unless you have set the attribute <code>report-success="true"</code> in the <code>publisher-upload-manifest</code> tag of your manifest.</p>

          <h2>Handling the POST</h2>
          <p>When the data arrives, you need to do something with these values. Any server side language will likely be able to function as a listener for these requests.</p>
          <p>The most common actions to take would be to append these values to a log file, insert these values as a row in a database, or send an email that contains the same information. In this example, we'll use the following PHP script to listen for these values and then write them to a log file:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

// build a string that constrains the current date and time
// and dump the POST data
//
$logEntry = date("m-d-y H:i:s") . ": ";
$post_dump = print_r($_POST, TRUE);

// tell PHP where it can find the log file and tell PHP to open it
// and add the string and data dump we created earlier to it.
$logFileLocation = 'log.txt';
$fileHandle = fopen($logFileLocation, 'a') or die("-1");
fwrite($fileHandle, $logEntry);
// also write the dump of the POST vars
fwrite($fileHandle, $post_dump);
fclose($fileHandle);

            First Rendition Complete Callback
          </h5>
          <p>
            This is a variant of the Asset Create Success Callback. The first Asset Create Success Callback usually corresponds to the preserved source rendition asset of an ingest. This upload does not have a ref id in the existing upload flow. However, we will encode a ref id onto the preserved source rendition and supply it as the refid of the preserved source rendition creation complete callback.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with other asset/image created callbacks, this callback will fire after all ingest processing is complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
<pre><code>"preservesource": [

        ...
    }},

            All Renditions Complete Callback
          </h5>
          <p>
            The All Renditions Complete Callback will use the same format as other batch processing callbacks. A new entity type, 'RENDITIONS', will be introduced for the callback. This callback will use the refid and id of the corresponding video. The action field will be set to 'CREATE', and the status field will be set to 'COMPLETE', indicating that all renditions of the video have been created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Callback Example:
            All Renditions Complete Callback: Entity: RENDITIONS, Refid: GSFN_a37c921sag7tl5vm_1332859193, Id: 1429940531001, Action: CREATE, Status: SUCCESS, Error: Null-Value
