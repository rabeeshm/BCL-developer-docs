<h1>Brightcove Video Cloud: Media API Reference</h1>
                <p>The Media API allows you to interact with your Video Cloud library. The API includes Read and Write modules for both videos and playlists. In addition, this reference describes a number of related objects.</p>
                <p>For reference information about the objects returned by or passed into the Media API, see the <a href="#Media_Objects">Media Object Reference</a>. In addition to the usage examples included in this reference, see <a href="//support.brightcove.com/en/docs/topic/media-api-examples">these more extensive examples</a> that demonstrate how to use the Media API.</p>
                <p class="text-warning"> <strong>The Media Write API is available only for Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise customers.</strong> If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please <a href="//www.brightcove.com/en/company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact Brightcove</a> for more information.</p>

                    <h3>Important note for publishers in Japan</h3>
                    <p>Publishers in Japan who access Studio using <code>videocloud.brightcove.co.jp</code> must use a different URL to access the Media APIs. In each case, instead of using a URL that begins <code>http://api.brightcove.com</code>, Japanese publishers must use a URL that begins <code>http://api.brightcove.co.jp</code>.</p>
                    <p>If you access Studio via <code>videocloud.brightcove.com</code>, regardless of your location you should use the regular service URLs.</p>

            <div class="section" id="rateLimiting">
                  <h2>Rate limiting</h2>
                  <p>The Media API is intended to be used as a tool for integrating your CMS or other backend systems with Video Cloud. It is not built for high-volume runtime access.</p>
                  <h3>Read methods</h3>
                  <p>Access frequency for read requests should be limited to 5 total requests per second from one or more devices, and for long-running requests (returning large datasets), no more than 10 concurrent requests are permitted.</p>
                  <h3>Write methods</h3>
                  <p>Write requests are single-threaded, so you should wait for a response to a request before submitting another one.</p>
              </div>
            <div class="section" id="tokens">
                <h2>Authorization Tokens</h2>
                <p>All Media API calls require a token. Video Cloud issues tokens to accounts that are enabled to use the API. There are separate tokens for read methods and write methods in the API. You append your token to the call as a URL parameter, <code>such as token=[tokenString]</code>, where <code>tokenString</code> is your URL-encoded token. Note: Media API tokens generally end with one or more dots (.). Be sure to include the dots when you use the API tokens - it's easy to lose them when you cut and paste. You can view and manage your API tokens on the <strong>Account Settings: API Management</strong> page in Video Cloud Studio, which provides a buttons for emailing tokens or copying them to your clipboard. For more information about tokens, see <a href="//support.brightcove.com/en/docs/managing-media-api-tokens">Managing Media API Tokens</a>.</p>
                <h3>Protecting your API tokens on the wire</h3>
                <p>To guard against attempts to sniff out your tokens, consider making your API requests via HTTPS, rather than HTTP. All you need to do to use HTTPS is to make your API call with the <code>https://</code> protocol, instead of <code>http://</code>, which instructs the browser to encrypt the transaction, including your token. There are performance drawbacks to using HTTPS, because the server and browser need to encrypt and decrypt the traffic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="requestParameters">
                <h2>Request Parameters</h2>
                <p>For the Read APIs, all parameters are passed as URL parameters. For example:</p>
                <textarea class="code-area">http://api.brightcove.com/services/library?command=search_videos&amp;token=WDGO_XdKqXUpy8fzD41MKA8kAhQRAmdux8cu8LNhRzAywCnuBpgV_A..&amp;any=birds</textarea>
                <p>For the Write APIs, all parameters are passed in the request body as JSON-RPC. For Example:</p>
                <pre><code>{ "method": "update_video",
    "params": {
        "token": "...", "video" : {
            "id" : 1234,
            "name" : "new name"
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="datetime">
                <h2>Date/Time Data</h2>
                <p>All date/time data returned by the Media API is in <em>milliseconds</em> of epoch time. It is independent of your time zone or the time zone set for your Video Cloud account in the Account Settings. If you need to present data in a way specific to a time zone, you will need to convert the epoch date/time to a local date/time. See the <a href="//www.epochconverter.com">Epoch Converter</a> site for tools for date and time conversion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="disabledVideos">
                <h2>Disabled videos</h2>
                <p>A video in your account many be disabled for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>it has been deleted</li>
                    <li>it has been set to <em>inactive</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>it has been scheduled for a future date</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most of the Media API search methods, such a <code>search_videos</code> and <code>find_video_by_id</code>, will not return disabled videos. To return inactive videos or videos scheduled for a future date, you can use <code><a href="#find_modified_videos">find_modified_videos</a></code> or one of the <code>_unfiltered</code> methods. Note: the _unfiltered methods are not enabled by default. To enable them, submit a request to <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/contact">Brightcove Support</a>
                </p>
                <p>The <strong>only</strong> method that will return deleted videos is <a href="#find_modified_videos"><code>find_modified_videos</code></a>. You can see a working sample <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/media/samples/find_modified_videos.html">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="section" id="analytics">
                <h2>Analytics Data</h2>
                <p>Data returned for videos includes two pieces of basic analytics data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>playsTotal</code>: how many times the Video has been played since its creation</li>
                    <li><code>playsTrailingWeek</code>: how many times the Video has been played within the past seven days, exclusive of today (calculated based on UTC time)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="BCL-aside"><strong>NOTE</strong>: this data is derived from the <a href="../../analytics-api/index.html">Analytics API</a>, but it is <strong>not</strong> real-time data. The value returned by the Media API is updated daily and reflects daily data. In addition, these values come from the analytics historical data collection, which a processed and adjusted version of the real-time data, so in some cases you may find recent data missing from the values reported by the Media API, as that data has not be processed yet. See the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/analytics-api/guides/faq.html#fieldsAndItems">Analytics API FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="bestPractice">
                <h2>Best practices</h2>
                <h3>Write requests</h3>
                <p>
                    Write requests are single threaded - concurrent requests are not allowed from the same account, and if a write request is received while another is still being processed, it will fail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, you should limit write requests that send data of any kind (videos, images, caption files, etc.) to no more than 20 per minute. Otherwise you will likely see timeouts or processing delays.
                </p>
                <h3>Large Data Sets</h3>
                <p>If you are retrieving all the videos in your account, or a large number of videos, there are some things you must be aware of:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You may be tempted to use the largest allowed <code>page_size</code> (100), but it's better to retrieve videos in batches of 25 or less to minimize the possibility of API requests timing out</li>
                    <li>As you are paging through large data sets, it is possible that the video data may be updated during the operation, which could cause items to shift in responses:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You might see an item repeated on successive pages</li>
                            <li>An item might be missed, as it has shifted to a previous response set</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To account for the first possibility, your app should de-dupe the complete item list after you have finished retrieving videos. To handle the second possibility, you need to compare the total number of items retrieved (after de-duping) to the number you were expecting, and then rerun the requests, sorting the results by last_modified_date (descending) - you shouldn't need to retrieve more than one batch to pick up missed items.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can decrease the likelihood of the scenarios in the previous item by sorting the returned results appropriately. If you do not explicitly set the <code>sort_by</code> parameter, results are sorted by <strong>relevance</strong> based on a complex algorithm that looks combinations of keywords, tags, and custom field values. If you are searching for videos based on  multiple keywords, tags, and/or custom fields, sort by relevance is exactly what you want. However, if you are just trying to retrieve all or a large set of your videos, setting the <code>sort_by</code> parameter explicitly will give you more control over the order of the returned items.</li>
                </ol>
