      <h1>Editing Translations</h1>
      <h2>What you need to know:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>URL parameter to enable the translation editor: <code>?language_edit=1</code></li>
        <li>username: <code>dev-54ta5gq-6sglloa4yrkti</code></li>
        <li>password: <code>s69bHkr7</code></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>IMPORTANT: Before you begin</h2>
      <p>If the problem (or part of it) is things translated that should not be (such as product names or code), <strong>it is better to fix that in the English source rather than edit the translation.</strong> Just submit a KNOW ticket indicating the page URL, and whether the issue is product names, code, or something else. The Learning Services team will fix it.</p>
      <h3>Limitations of the editor</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Every HTML tag is treated as a separate editable block. That means you can only make changes within that block, and you cannot change the order of blocks. Also, if you delete the translated text in a block entirely, the existing translation will be used.</li>
        <li>The Neural Network (the artificial intelligence part of the system) is both a help and an obstacle:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Good</strong>: when you change one instance of a mis-translated phrase, you should see other instances on the same page automatically changed. In a day or two, you will also see the same correction automatically made in other pages.</li>
          <li><strong>The Bad</strong>: it is not totally reliable, though. It sometimes misses fixing instances, I think because they are in a different kind of tag (a list item rather than a paragraph, for example).</li>
          <li><strong>The Ugly</strong>: worse than missing some, it is an all or nothing game. The change will be made everywhere, even if you do not want it to be. For example, there is no way to specify that "Audience" should not be translated when it is used a product name, but should be translated if it is used as a ordinary word. You have to choose what is the less bad thing to do in those cases.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Things you should <strong>not</strong> edit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Code blocks</strong> - these should never be translated - we can fix the source to prevent that. Please submit a KNOW ticket with the URL.</li>
        <li><strong>XNUMX</strong> - this is a placeholder for a number - the number from the English source doc will always be used. You will see the number when you leave editing mode.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Open a KNOW ticket (via JIRA or email to docs@brightcove.com) indicating what page you are going to edit, so that you can assign the changes to a reviewer when you're finished</li>
        <li>Open the page in your browser in the language you want to edit.</li>
        <li>Add the URL param <code>?language_edit=1</code> to the end of the URL, and press <strong>return</strong> to reload the page.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/add-url-param.png" alt="Add URL Param">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Add URL Param</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>An authentication dialog will open - enter the <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> shown above.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/authentication.png" alt="Authetication">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Authetication</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>If you allow your browser to store the username and password, you will not have to enter them again for any page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>You will now see a Translation Editor Panel in the upper-left corner of the page - you can use this panel to edit the page title or to turn off the translation editor.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/edit-panel.png" alt="Editor Panel">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Editor Panel</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>You will see edit icons beside blocks of text that can be edited:
          <ul>
            <li><img src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/green-edit-icon.png" alt="Green Edit Icon"> (Green edit icon means this text is the original machine translation)</li>
            <li><img src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/red-edit-icon.png" alt="Red Edit Icon"> (Red edit icon means that this text has been edited by someone)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </body>
