        <h1>Embed APIs Guide</h1>
        <p>This topic will assist you in deciding when and how to use the Embed APIs. The decision of choosing between using the Player Configuration APIs versus the Embed APIs is an important one and the content in this document will guide you in these decisions.</p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">The curl statements in this guide build upon the work done in the <a href="../getting-started/player-mgmt-quick-start.html">Quick Start to Player Management</a>. Working through this guide after doing the Quick Start to Player Management allows you to see the changes made to a child player, and just importantly the features inherited from the parent player.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="whatisembed" class="section">
        <h2>Why use the embed APIs?</h2>
        <p>The embed APIs allow you to create multiple instances of a particular player. A good way to think of this player/instance relationship is as a parent/child relationship. The single player is the parent, and players created with the embed APIs are children of the parent player. The parent player has the bulk of the properties you wish your player to have, and then you can use the embed APIs to customize subsets of properties on different child players. For example, you can load different media or use different plugins and styling with different child players.</p>
        <p>The following diagrams help clarify the functionality. Below the parent is shown on the left, and two child players on the right. Observe that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The poster is inherited by both children</li>
            <li>The shape of the play button is inherited by the top child, while it is overridden in the bottom child</li>
            <li>The top child adds a property, in this case an overlay, which the parent does not have</li>
        </ul>
        <div><img src="assets/embeds-api-guide-parent-child-1.png"></div>
        <p>Another powerful feature of this parent/child relationship is that the inheritance is ongoing. The following diagram shows a new poster assigned to the parent, and both children will inherit that configuration change.</p>
        <div><img src="assets/embeds-api-guide-parent-child-2.png"></div>
        <h2>When NOT to use the embed APIs</h2>
        <p>While there are some good reasons to use the embed APIs if your use case needs it, there's also some good reasons to stick with regular players. Here are a few:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Child players can not be edited using Video Cloud Studio. You can only edit child players through the Player Management API. You can edit the parent player of a child player in Video Cloud Studio, however, a change made to the parent player affects all child players.</li>
          <li>Publishing a parent player can take a long time if you have a lot of child players associated with that parent player. Each child player is published separately, and if you have more than 30 child players, you can expect some delays in your child player publishing. This would be exactly the same case as publishing 30 regular players at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given the reasons above, it may make sense to start with using regular players, and then trying out embeds when you see the need for child players.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notation" class="section">
        <h2>Child player URLs</h2>
        <p>How do you differentiate between the parent player and child players? The URLs will be different. For example, a parent player's URL is:</p>
        <p><code>http://players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/0181ea5c-5b4d-46f5-bae9-c16b092c20d3_default/index.html</code></p>
        <p>After using the embed APIs to create a child player, the child player's ID added to the parent's URL, as shown here:</p>
        <p><code>http://players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/0181ea5c-5b4d-46f5-bae9-c16b092c20d3_<strong>c912d695-9756-4a07-84a3-4d14ed88665e</strong>/index.html</code></p>
      </div>
      <div id="why" class="section">
        <h2>Parent/child use case</h2>
        <p>Assume you use multiple video players. Often, the common features of the players are very nearly the same, but in a few instances you want to tweak the player for special cases. You could create multiple players using the Player Configuration APIs with <code>POST</code> and <code>PATCH</code> methods, but this could lead to significant maintenance issues. For instance, say you wanted to change the poster for all the players. This would mean using <code>PATCH</code> on all the different players. Whereas if you created child players, you would only <code>PATCH</code> the parent player, and all the child players would automatically have the new poster.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="creationprocess" class="section">
        <h2>Creation process</h2>
        <p>If you have done the <a href="../getting-started/player-mgmt-quick-start.html">Quick Start to Player Management</a> you have seen the process of using curl statements to communicate HTTP methods to the Player Management API. The same approach will be used here.</p>
        <p>To create a player you have most likely used a few HTTP methods with the Player Configuration APIs, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create the player using a <code>POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players</em></li>
            <li>Update the player using a <code>PATCH</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/configuration</em></li>
            <li>Publish the updated player using a <code>POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/publish</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A similar approach will be used for child players using the embed APIs. At a very high level you will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create an child player using a <code>POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/<strong>embeds</strong></em>. Note: Child players created with the embed APIs self publish on creation so there is no need to publish on child player creation, only on child player update.</li>
            <li>Update the child player using a <code>PATCH</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/<strong>embeds/$EMBED_ID/configuration</strong></em></li>
            <li>Publish the child player using a <code>POST</code> to <em>https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/<strong>embeds/$EMBED_ID/publish</strong></em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following content describes the process in detail.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="createembed" class="section">
        <h2>Create child player</h2>
        <p>To create a child player you use an HTTP <code>POST</code> method, as shown here:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="255-272"></code></p>
        <p>An example response to the child player creation is as follows:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="322-329"></code></p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: The child player self publishes on creation, so there is no need to publish the child player after creation. You still must publish child player if it is altered with a <code>PATCH</code> method. At this point the preview information is not helpful as you can use the published child player immediately upon creation.</p>
        <p>You can now use the <code>url</code> property from the child player to see the results. In the example below the child player was added to the parent player created in the Quick Start to Player Management. You see the new poster and video, but the overlay plugin from the parent player is still present.</p>
        <div><img src="assets/embed-guide-robin.png"></div>
      </div>
      <div id="updateembed" class="section">
        <h2>Update child player</h2>
        <p>To update the child player you use an HTTP <code>PATCH</code> method. The following curl statement updates the <code>poster</code> property. It is assumed you have set the <code>$EMBED_ID</code> environment variable appropriately:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="336-347"></code></p>
        <p>The response provides preview information for both a <code>preview_url</code> and <code>preview_embed_code</code> code:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="350-353"></code></p>
      </div>
      <div id="publishembed" class="section">
        <h2>Publish child player</h2>
        <p>Once the child player is altered you will need to publish it. Be sure the <code>$EMBED_ID</code> environment variable is set and you can then publish the newly altered child player:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="281-285"></code></p>
        <p>The response provides the vital information needed to use the child player, very much like publishing a player does:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="357-362"></code></p>
      </div>
      <div id="arrayfields" class="section">
        <h2>Array fields</h2>
        <p>By default when you create a child player, data in the child player overrides like data that would otherwise be inherited from the parent player. For instance, if you have a <code>poster</code> field in the parent player and <code>poster</code> field in the child player, the resulting <code>poster</code> field value will be the one from the child player. This situation is different for fields that contain arrays. When the data type of the field is an array, you can choose the inheritance behavior to be overwrite, prepend or append. The fields whose data type is an array, and for which you can control inheritance behavior are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>scripts</li>
          <li>stylesheets</li>
          <li>plugins</li>
          <li>sources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can add special field names to the configuration object to control array inheritance, and change the default behavior of child players overriding parent player data. If a array field in a child player's configuration has a property called <code>array_prepend</code> or <code>array_append</code> the data will be correspondingly prepended or appended to the parent player's data for the like field.</p>
        <p>Consider the example where you have a parent player with the following data for the <code>stylesheets</code> field with a single stylesheet included in its array:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="8-10"></code></p>
        <p>You are then going to create a child player, and you want to add two addition stylesheets, and be sure they are listed AFTER the existing stylesheet for correct cascading. In this use case you would use a curl statement similar to the following:</p>
      <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="79-91" data-gist-highlight-line="85"></code></p>
        <p>On line 85 the <code>array_append</code> field name is added before the actual array of stylesheets. The resulting stylesheet configuration for the child player will be:</p>
      <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="100-104"></code></p>
        <p>It is possible for the same field to use both <code>array_prepend</code> and <code>array_append</code> in an child player's configuration. It might be the case that the order of stylesheets is important to ensure correct cascading of styles. The following curl statement prepends one stylesheet above the exiting stylesheet, while another stylesheet is appended:</p>
      <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="179-193"></code></p>
        <p>The resulting configuration for the child player's <code>stylesheet</code> field would appear as follows:</p>
      <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="202-206"></code></p>
        <h3>Merge errors</h3>
        <p>Remember that <code>array_prepend</code> or <code>array_append</code> only work when the marker is used on a field that is an array. As well, the data associated with the <code>array_prepend</code> or <code>array_append</code> must also be an array.</p>
        <p>If you do make mistakes, excellent error messages of HTTP status code type 409 (Conflict) will be returned. Two examples follow:</p>
      <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="221-228"></code></p>
      </div>
      <div id="displayembed" class="section">
        <h2>Display child info</h2>
        <p>You can use the HTTP <code>GET</code> method to retrieve the information about a child player. An example curl statement is:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="289-293"></code></p>
        <p>A fairly large amount of JSON data is returned. The configuration_override section displays the settings provided when the child player was created.</p>
      <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="297-310"></code></p>
      </div>
      <div id="deletingembeds" class="section">
        <h2>Delete child players</h2>
        <p>You can also delete a child player by using the <code>DELETE</code> method. Here is an example curl statement to delete a child player:</p>
       <p><code data-gist-id="11401488" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="314-318"></code></p>
        <p>Of course, this will affect only the child player and not the parent player.</p>
