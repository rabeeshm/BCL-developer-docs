          <h1>Quick Start to Player Management</h1>
          <p>In this quick start  you will  perform the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a player</li>
            <li>Update the player to display an image until the video is started</li>
            <li>Customize a player by adding a plugin</li>
            <li>Display the configuration for a player</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="BCL-aside">For details on the API used in this document you can view the <a href="player-mgmt-api-overview.html">Player Management API Overview</a> document and the <a href="../reference/versions/v1/index.html">Player Management API</a> reference.</p>
          <p class="text-warning">Note: The steps in the document involve curl and other command-line tools that are native to Mac and Linux systems, but not part of the Windows operating system. If you are on Windows, you can get these tools by installing <a href="//cygwin.com">cygwin</a>. During the install, you will be prompted for packages to install. Open the <strong>Net</strong> package, then check the <strong>curl</strong> option and then finish the installation. Once you have done this, you will be able to follow the Quick Start to Player Management successfully as written using the cygwin command line. Tools are available to run curl at the normal Windows command line, but not detailed in this document.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="getstarted">
          <h2><a name"getstarted"></a>Get started</h2>
          <p>The approach this Quick Start takes is to use curl statements to communicate with the Player Service API. The curl tool is used at the command line to transfer data with URL syntax. More information about curl can be obtained from <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se</a>.</p>
          <p>You certainly do not have to use curl as we do in this Quick Start for simplicities' sake. You can, of course, use your favorite language to communicate with the APIs. Check out the <a href="../samples/examples-overview.html">Examples Home Page</a> which demonstrates how to use basic authentication, AJAX and JavaScript to write some mini-apps for basic tasks like creating a player, displaying all your players, deleting players, etc.</p>
          <p>A few preliminary steps need to be taken before you can start using the API. These are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Login to Video Cloud Studio. If you have multiple accounts, use the drop-down to select the one in which you'd like to create your new players. For the credential system to work properly, you need to have admin rights on this account. If you are unsure if a user has admin rights, go to the Users Settings page to see  Users listed along with their role.</li>
            <li>In Video Cloud Studio, click the <strong>gear icon</strong> to access your settings, then select the <strong>Account Information</strong> option. From there copy your <strong>Account ID</strong>.</li>
            <li>At the command line, enter the following to assign the Account ID value to an environment variable:</li>
            <pre><code>export ACCOUNT_ID=<em>YourAccountID</em></code></pre>
            <li>Authentication will be handled by supplying your Perform account email address as part of the curl statement, and then the API will prompt you for a password. Since the email address will be used frequently, also assign that value to an environment variable:</li>
            <pre><code>export EMAIL=<em>YourEmailAddress</em></code></pre>
          </ul>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: If you wish to confirm the environment variables have been assigned correctly, you can display them using the <code>echo</code> command, for instance: <code>echo $ACCOUNT_ID</code>.</p>
          <p>You are now ready to start using the API.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="createPlayer">
          <h2><a name"createPlayer"></a>Create a player</h2>
          <p>You can now create a player with a call to the Player Management API. This API call is explained in full detail in the <a href="player-mgmt-api-overview.html">Player Management API Overview</a> document. It is suggested you copy and paste the following curl statements to the command line.</p>
          <p>The following steps assist you in creating a player.</p>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: If you are not comfortable using curl statements and the command line, many REST-client apps exist. Information on using a REST-client Chrome browser plugin called Postman is detailed in the <a href="../guides/postman.html">Using Postman for HTTP Requests</a> document.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The first curl statement creates the player and assigns a video to it. After you paste this statement at the command line and press <em>Enter</em>, you will be prompted for your password.</li>
            <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="1-16"></code></p>
            <p>You will see the server returns response data in JSON format:</p>
            <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="17-24"></code></p>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: At this time the <code>preview_url</code> and <code>preview_embed_code</code> will not be discussed. Later in this document the differences between preview and published players will be covered.</p>
            <li>View your video by using one (or all) of the following values:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Copy the <code>url</code> into a browser to see your player.</li>
              <li>Copy the <code>embed_code</code> into an HTML page to view your player in an iframe. For this to function properly, the page containing the iframe must be served from an actual HTTP server.</li>
              <li>The <code>embed_in_page</code> feature's use is detailed in the <a href="../guides/embed-in-page.html">embed_in_page Guide</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: You can use multiple players on the same HTML page.</p>
          </ol>
        </div>
      <div id="vcvideo" class="section video-cloud-only">
        <h2>Video Cloud videos</h2>
        <p>Of course you can create a player using a video from your Video Cloud library. Instead of using a <code>media</code> section in the JSON data, you use a <code>video_cloud</code> section. The curl statement below shows player creation using a Video Cloud video's ID.</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="240-252" data-gist-highlight-line="247-249"></code></p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Instead of using the ID, you can use the video's reference ID with the syntax <code>"video": "ref:1234refid"</code>.</p>
        <p>The response is logically equivalent to the response when creating a player using <strong>media/sources/src</strong> as shown above.</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="258-265"></code></p>
        <p>You can see the player's configuration by browsing the URL value returned and change the <strong>index.html</strong> to <strong>config.json</strong>. For the player created by the curl statement above, you would see the following:</p>
        <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="269-284" data-gist-highlight-line="270-273"></code></p>
        <p>The <code>policy_key</code> is  automatically added to the player's configuration. This is created using the Policy API, and it will allow for special restrictions to be placed on your player for accessing different videos. In other words, the policy key controls which videos can be viewed when.</p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: You can also add your own policy key to a configuration instead of having one generated. The normal rules for player and player child config interaction apply here: a policy key that is set at the player child level will override any policy key set at the player level.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="section" id="updatePlayer">
          <h2><a name"updatePlayer"></a>Update a player</h2>
          <p>You have now performed the basics for creating a player with a video in it. Next, you will learn how to do a simple update of the player. In this case, we will provide a thumbnail/poster image that appears before the video begins playing, as well as add an HLS formatted video to the sources. The HLS video is listed first for a reason, as the player will attempt to play that particular video format first. If that fails, the player will fall back to the MP4 version.</p>
          <p class="text-warning">Note: When defining your HLS source be sure that you set the video type to <code>application/x-mpegURL</code></p>
         <ol start="3">
          <li>In the returned JSON from player creation an <code>id</code> value was displayed. Copy this into a <code>PLAYER_ID</code> environment variable.</li>
          <pre><code>export PLAYER_ID=<em>YourPlayerID</em></code></pre>
           <li>To update the player you will use the HTTP <code>PATCH</code> method. You will send data to update your player. You will provide the information for the poster image,  as well as HLS and MP4 videos, as part of the curl statement. Copy and paste the following curl statement and execute it.</li>
            <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="53-74"></code></p>
            <li>Check to be sure the server returns data which includes the <code>id</code>, <code>preview_url</code> and <code>preview_embed_code</code> values in the following JSON format:</li>
            <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="156-160"></code></p>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: After an update you have a preview version of the player. The change is NOT reflected in the published version of the player you were working with prior to the update.</p>
          <li>Use either the <code>preview_url</code> or <code>preview_embed_code</code> values to see the changes in your player's configuration. You will see a different image (poster) displayed before you start the video playing than you saw on player creation, which simply uses the first frame of the video as a poster.</li>
          <p class="BCL-aside">The poster displayed on player creation shows one tiger. Now the poster shows two tigers, and has a Brightcove watermark indicating it is a preview version of the player.</p>
          <li>Now you'll publish the player to push it to the correct location for users to view. Enter the following command:</li>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="26-30"></code></p>
          <p>Once the player is published you will have players that differ from the preview versions. The published versions differ from the preview versions in these ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The JavaScript and CSS are minified, concatenated and inlined into the player directly.</li>
            <li>A low resolution version of the poster image is generated and inlined into the page to improve perceived load times on networks with a high request-setup time (i.e. cellular data networks).</li>
            <li>The previous version of the player is saved so it can be recovered if problems are discovered after the update goes live.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: On player creation (step 1 above) the player is also automatically published. That is why on player creation the JSON response included both published and preview information.</p>
          <li>Check to be sure the JSON response from publishing the player appears as follows:</li>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="165-170"></code></p>
          <li>Use one of the player implementations to be sure your published player is functioning correctly.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="customizePlayer">
          <h2><a name"customizePlayer"></a>Customize a player</h2>
          <p>You can customize your player using plugins. You can learn how to include pre-existing plugins in your player or build your own in the <a href="../guides/plugin-dev-quick-start.html">Quick Start to Plugin Development</a>.</p>
          <p>In this case you will use a very simple pre-existing plugin to overlay a text message on the video. Following is the code for a plugin that creates an HTML paragraph tag. Note: a classname and text is assigned to the paragraph, then it is appended to the existing player. This plugin already exists for your convenience and is located at <a href="//solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/video-js/new-player/first-plugin.js">http://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/video-js/new-player/first-plugin.js</a>.</p>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="79-85"></code></p>
          <p>The paragraph needs to be styled to prevent, in this particular instance, black text on a black background. The following are styles applied to the paragraph's classname. This stylesheet already exists for your convenience and is located at <a href="//solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/video-js/new-player/first-plugin.css">http://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/video-js/new-player/first-plugin.css</a>.</p>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="88-97"></code></p>
          <p>Just as you used a curl statement to assign the video source and poster image, you will use a curl statement to tell the player the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Location of the JavaScript file that contains the code for the plugin</li>
            <li>Location of the stylesheet</li>
            <li>The plugin name to be used with the player</li>
          </ul>
          <ol start="10">
          <li>Use the following curl statement to make the plugin functional.</li>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="99-114"></code></p>
          <li>Use the following curl statement to publish the updated player. This is the same publish code that you used in the previous section to publish a player.</li>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="26-30"></code></p>
          <li>Copy the returned URL and browse it. You will see that the plugin is functioning and the plugin text is displayed.</li>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: There may be a slight delay before you see the plugin functioning correctly as it can take a small amount of time for the player to be published. If you don't see the plugin, periodically refresh your page.</p>
          <div><img src="assets/show-plugin-text.png" alt="show-plugin-text" width="777" height="554"></div>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="displayconfiguration">
          <h2><a name"displayconfiguration"></a>Display configuration</h2>
          <ol start="13">
          <p>To debug and confirm work you have done it is often helpful to view a player's configuration.</p>
          <li>To do this, use a <code>GET</code> method with the <code>configuration</code> URL.</li>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="117-121"></code></p>
          <li>Check to be sure the JSON configuration response is similar to the following:</li>
          <p><code data-gist-id="8759542" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="124-148"></code></p>
          </ol>
          <p>Another way to get a look at the player's configuration is by browsing the URL value returned and change the <strong>index.html</strong> to <strong>config.json</strong>.</p>

          <h2><a name"deliverySystem"></a>Delivery system APIs</h2>
          <p>The Delivery System APIs allow for the management and deployment of a group of files, called a repository. These files are managed through REST APIs and through git. These APIs shouldn't be needed by most people when creating or editing players, but they can be a very interesting set of APIs to use for other purposes.
