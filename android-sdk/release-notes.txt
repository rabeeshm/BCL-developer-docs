Version 4.1.22:

  SDK changes:

  HLS Player changes:

    * Modified SeamlessVideoDisplayComponent to turn off the video
      stream for the prebuffering player earlier during

      from the next video could be heard.

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Modified the GoogleIMAVideoAdPlayer to listen for SEEK_TO events
      and suppress reporting progress until playback has progressed at
      lesat 1 second.  This prevents all the accumulated midrolls from
      piling up and being played when slowly scrubbing to the end of a

      0.9.8za.  The VisualOn 3.11.26 update in version 4.1.17
      unknowingly reverted the previous libvossl_OSMP library update.

      captioning for the current playing video.

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed issue where when starting playback from a non-zero
      position, playback would skip back to that non-zero position
      after the first ad finished.  This was a side effect of the fix
      in 4.1.18.
